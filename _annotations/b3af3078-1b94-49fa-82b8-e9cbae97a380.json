Old Nandy is &ldquo;in a grove of little old men&rdquo; (LD 357). Dickens may have been recalling his earlier visit to a workhouse detailed in his <em>Household Words</em> article &ldquo;A Walk in the Workhouse&rdquo; from 1850, in which he had used the same language: &ldquo;Groves of babies in arms; groves of mothers and other sick women in bed; groves of lunatics; jungles of men in stone-paved down-stairs day-rooms, waiting for their dinners; longer and longer groves of old people&rdquo; (206).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stone renders the non-textual marking after this note as a closing parenthesis, but it may be another form of non-textual marking.</p>"

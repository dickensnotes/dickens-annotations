But although the Working Note predominantly deals with the lead up to this symbolic ending, it is also significantly punctuated by memoranda above that open up future possibilities for the narrative: \"Steerforth\"; \"Peggotty's enquiries about school\"; \"Tells her of Barkis.\" The inclusion of these memoranda indicates Dickens's careful negotiation of twin narrative compulsions: the forward-looking and the retrospective. The novel's autobiographical mode looks backwards, working against the forward propulsion of serial form which, by its nature, always anticipates the next installment. By ensuring each serial part provided opportunities for the next number, Dickens kept up the momentum of the story whilst maintaining its retrospective focus. A great deal of <em>Copperfield</em>'s formal complexity is generated and sustained by the maintenance of this tension. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

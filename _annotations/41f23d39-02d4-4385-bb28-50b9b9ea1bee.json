He goes through life &ldquo;constantly carrying his figures,&rdquo; and, since &ldquo;figures are catching, a kind of cyphering measles broke out&rdquo; (LD 774). Dickens may also have been considering this boxed note as he wrote the opening chapter of the number (chapter 30), which also makes reference to Pancks&rsquo;s &ldquo;incontrovertible figures,&rdquo; which &ldquo;had been the occupation of every moment of his leisure since he had lost his money&rdquo; (744).&nbsp;</p>"

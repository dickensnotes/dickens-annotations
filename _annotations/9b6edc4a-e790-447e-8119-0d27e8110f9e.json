The lack of light characterizes Dickens&rsquo;s introduction of the prison, which has &ldquo;no knowledge of the brightness outside&rdquo; (LD 5). This shaded quality is replicated in Browne&rsquo;s illustration (&ldquo;The Birds in the Cage&rdquo;), with its cavernous darkness.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The text of the novel follows this note&rsquo;s placement of the men as features within the shaded prison: &ldquo;In Marseilles that day there was a villainous prison. In one of its chambers, so repulsive a place that even the obtrusive stare blinked at it, and left it to such refuse of reflected light as it could find for itself, were two men&rdquo; (2). These chapter notes refer to the prison and the &ldquo;Picture&rdquo; of the two men, as well as a brief mention of the jailer&rsquo;s child and her song, but there is no indication in the Notes of the conversation between the prisoners, Rigaud&rsquo;s revelations about his history, or Rigaud&rsquo;s departure from the jail. The Notes are focused on character and description, here, rather than event.&nbsp;</p>",

[...]</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is perhaps in his enthusiastic decision (as indicated by the emphatic underlining of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;) to incorporate the Circumlocution Office in this number that Dickens is able to translate the inaction implied by his original title (\"Nobody&rsquo;s Fault\") into an element of the plot, thus allowing him to let go of this title.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Dickens establishes the ludicrousness of referring to Mews Street, Grosvenor Square, as an &ldquo;aristocratic part of town&rdquo; by describing the &ldquo;hideous little street&rdquo;&nbsp; filled with &ldquo;small airless houses&rdquo; that nevertheless &ldquo;went at enormous rents on account of their being abject hanger-on to a fashionable situation; and whenever one of these fearful little coops was to be let (which seldom happened, for they were in great request), the house agent advertised it as a gentlemanly residence in the most aristocratic part of town&rdquo; (LD 105). The differentiation between the &ldquo;public office&rdquo; and the private residence in Grosvenor Square is likely a reference to Barnacle Junior&rsquo;s differentiation of &ldquo;public&rdquo; from &ldquo;private business&rdquo; in chapter 10.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stone interprets what we have rendered as a non-textual marking underneath the &ldquo;Q&rdquo; of &ldquo;Quarter&rdquo; as &ldquo;of.&rdquo; It is difficult to make this out with certainty.</p>"

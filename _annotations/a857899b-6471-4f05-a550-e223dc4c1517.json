This note, with its imperative voice, refers to the questions Arthur asks himself about Little Dorrit at the close of this chapter. Dickens sets apart a penultimate paragraph: &ldquo;But Little Dorrit?&rdquo; before the final paragraph of the chapter, in which he writes: &ldquo;His original curiosity augmented every day, as he watched for her, saw or did not see her, and speculated about her. Influenced by his predominant idea, he even fell into a habit of discussing with himself the possibility of her being in some way associated with it. At last he resolved to watch Little Dorrit and know more of her story&rdquo; (LD 58).</p>",

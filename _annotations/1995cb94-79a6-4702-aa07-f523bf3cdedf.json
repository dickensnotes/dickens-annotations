As with the &ldquo;&amp;c&rdquo; in the note above, Dickens appears to be employing his own shorthand for the inclusion of material that requires no elaboration in the Notes.</p>\n<p><br />Some of the &ldquo;particulars&rdquo; of this &ldquo;family procession&rdquo; were added after initial composition. The paragraph in the novel beginning &ldquo;In the yard, was the usual chorus of people&rdquo; (414) and ending &ldquo;passed&rdquo; (417), which details those gathered to view the Dorrits&rsquo; departure, was inserted in the proofs on a separate manuscript slip (now bound with the proofs) when Dickens realized he had underwritten the number by more than a page. As Herring notes, &ldquo;the new addition is not simply padding: Dickens used the new paragraph to foreshadow the social prison Little Dorrit recognizes in Book II. The new paragraph is essentially an expanded version of one included in the <em>Household Words</em> article &lsquo;The Martyrs of Chancery&rsquo; [from February 15, 1851]... In this context, the new paragraph is Dickens&rsquo;s most explicit statement of the symbolic importance of the Marshalsea in Book II of <em>Little Dorrit</em>&rdquo; (Herring 43fn25).</p>"

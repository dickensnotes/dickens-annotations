He creates what Garrett Stewart calls a &ldquo;byzantine zigzag of descent&rdquo; (519) between Clennam&rsquo;s mother and Little Dorrit. As Brattin notes, &ldquo;Dickens obviously had great difficulty setting up the will so that it would be Frederick&rsquo;s youngest niece, and not Frederick himself, or Frederick&rsquo;s daughter &ndash; in fact, Frederick has no daughter, but of course Gilbert Clennam wouldn&rsquo;t have known that &ndash; who is to receive the legacy&rdquo; (113). In the manuscript of this chapter, the sentence that works out the terms of this legacy (&ldquo;A thousand guineas to the youngest daughter of her patron, or (if he had none) his brother&rsquo;s youngest daughter on her coming of age&rdquo; [757]) is produced only after numerous erasures, revisions, and interlineations. </span></p>"

Now that he had decided not to move the added chapter 4 to No. IV (see LD.I.R24 and LD.IV), he needed to return to this theme as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But the first paragraphs of this chapter also return us to another &ldquo;idea&rdquo; from No. I: that of travelers meeting and parting (see LD.I.L6): &ldquo;Which of the vast multitude of travellers under the sun and the stars, climbing the dusty hills and toiling along the weary plains, journeying by land and journeying by sea, coming and going so strangely, to meet at to act and to re-act on one another, which of the host may, with no suspicion of the journey&rsquo;s end, be travelling surely hither?&rdquo; (LD 173).</p>"

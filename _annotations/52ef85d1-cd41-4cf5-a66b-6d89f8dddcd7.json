What a competition and outbidding of each other in servility!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Full length Portrait of His Lordship, surrounded by Worshippers&rdquo; (8).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Indeed, at the end of chapter 25 (No. XVII), Dickens will reflect this language of worship and servility to reflect on Mr. Merdle&rsquo;s downfall: &ldquo;every servile worshipper of riches who had helped to set [Mr. Merdle] on his pedestal, would have done better to worship the Devil point-blank&rdquo; (LD 690-691).</p>"

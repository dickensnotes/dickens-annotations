This gradual revelation begins with the presence of a letter from Mr. Merdle, picked up by Physician at the scene of his death and handed to Bar. The reader does not get access to the content of the letter; we only view Bar&rsquo;s reaction: &ldquo;There was not much in it as to quantity; but, it made a great demand on his close and continuous attention&rdquo; (LD 688). The focus on Bar and Physician gives way to a consideration of the multitudes affected by Merdle&rsquo;s fraud, again without specifying the nature of the crime: &ldquo;If all those hundreds and thousands of beggared people who were yet asleep, could only know, as [Bar and Physician] spoke, the ruin that impended over them, what a fearful cry against one miserable soul would go up to Heaven!&rdquo; (689). After a paragraph speculating on the cause of death, the focus turns to rumors about Mr. Merdle&rsquo;s wealth: &ldquo;appalling whispers [began] to circulate, east, west, north, and south&rdquo; (690), which then get &ldquo;louder and higher,&rdquo; becoming a &ldquo;roar&rdquo; (691). The chapter culminates with the revelation of &ldquo;Forgery and Robbery&rdquo; in the final paragraph.</p>"

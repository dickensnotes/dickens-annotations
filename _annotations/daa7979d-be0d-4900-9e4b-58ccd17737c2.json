In his defense, Dickens wrote his own article in <em>Household Words</em> (&ldquo;Curious Misprint in the Edinburgh Review&rdquo;), insisting that the chapter was already &ldquo;written, was engraven on steel, was printed, and had passed through the hands of the compositors, readers of the press, and pressmen, and was in type and in proof&hellip; before the accident in Tottenham Court Road occurred&rdquo; (&ldquo;Curious Misprint&rdquo; 384). Although Dickens was exaggerating the timeline here, he had in fact composed the number before the accident, which occurred on May 9, the very day Dickens named to Wilkie Collins as that on which he had written &ldquo;the two little words of three letters each&rdquo; and &ldquo;finished&rdquo; the novel (Letters 8.322). The final double number was in print by May 30. For more on Dickens&rsquo;s response to this review, see Critical Introduction.&nbsp;</p>"

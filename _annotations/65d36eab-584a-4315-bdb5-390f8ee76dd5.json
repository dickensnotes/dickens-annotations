The emphasized &ldquo;Observe this always&rdquo; is a direction not just for this number, but for future numbers of Book II, since it establishes the rationale for Clennam&rsquo;s continued (if altered) relationship with Little Dorrit via her correspondence. This note refers to the &ldquo;pledge&rdquo; that took place in the &ldquo;Scene with Pet&rdquo; in No. VIII, chapter 28 (LD.VIII.R14), echoing his resolution first made in chapter 26 (&ldquo;Resolves never to disparage him&rdquo; LD.VIII.R3). Dickens reminds himself of Clennam&rsquo;s resolution here, since he plans to have Clennam struggle with his dislike for Gowan in chapter 34.&nbsp;</p>"

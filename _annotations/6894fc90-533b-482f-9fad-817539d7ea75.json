[...]</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-6ff4aaab-7fff-fc21-51ae-389c720f75ff\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although Dickens decides that he will &ldquo;hardly&rdquo; indicate how Clennam &ldquo;stands toward [Little] Dorrit,&rdquo; this number will in fact center on Clennam&rsquo;s growing interest in Amy. This is the first number in which Dickens consistently uses &ldquo;Little Dorrit&rdquo; to refer to Amy, despite the fact that the Note uses just &ldquo;Dorrit,&rdquo; which may (along with the blue ink) suggest that these memoranda were written before composition began. What is perhaps most significant about the left-hand memoranda for this Note is their lack of attention to Little Dorrit herself, especially given her significance in this number with the novel&rsquo;s new title and the shift to her perspective in the final chapter. Indeed, no mention is made in these memoranda of Little Dorrit&rsquo;s night on the streets, the central event of No. IV. Perhaps, then, Dickens shifted his focus to Little Dorrit only after he had written these questions, perhaps even as he wrote this number.</p>"

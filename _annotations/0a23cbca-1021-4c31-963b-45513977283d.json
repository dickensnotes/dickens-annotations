It is interesting that Mr. Murdstone does not appear in this list of character queries, considering his notable reappearance in chapter 33. Dickens&rsquo;s decision to reintroduce Murdstone shortly after the return of his sister in No. IX may indicate his desire to keep both of the Murdstones in view in anticipation of a greater role for them in later numbers (see <em>DC.XIII.L3</em>). In No. XI David observes his stepfather preparing for another potentially destructive marriage, comes to terms with Emily and Steerforth&rsquo;s elopement, visits the divorce court with Mr. Spenlow, and learns of the &ldquo;misplaced affection&rdquo; of Miss Mills&rsquo;s youth (DC 488). Each of these incidents reflects forebodingly on his burgeoning relationship with Dora, the central matter of chapter 33. To all these, Dickens also apparently considered adding &ldquo;the Doctor and his wife,&rdquo; but he ultimately chose to defer their appearance to the following month, and it is not until No. XV that Annie Strong&rsquo;s attachment to Jack Maldon is &ldquo;brought to bear on David, and applied by him to himself (DC_WN_15). </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Louisa experiences the &ldquo;dawn of knowledge of her immaterial self&rdquo; in this &lsquo;number&rsquo; through her encounter with Stephen Blackpool, but this dawn comes &ldquo;Too Late&rdquo; for her to escape her entanglement with Harthouse. The appearance of these phrases on the Working Note suggest that they were written at the same time, with the more ambiguous phrase &ldquo;Scarcely yet&rdquo; clearly having been added to the Working Note later in a visibly distinct shade of blue ink. The right-hand side of the Note captures the rapid progress of these tensions in the number: Harthouse is introduced in chapter 17; he &ldquo;sees Louisa for the first time&rdquo; in chapter 18; Tom &ldquo;shews him everything&rdquo; about her situation and character in chapter 19; Louisa is present for the &ldquo;Scene at Bounderby&rsquo;s&rdquo; in chapter 21; and the &ldquo;Scene at Stephens [sic]&rdquo; closes the &lsquo;number&rsquo; in chapter 22.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The &ldquo;Scarcely yet&rdquo; might be interpreted as suggesting that it is not yet clear at the conclusion of this &lsquo;number&rsquo; that this &ldquo;dawn&rdquo; of Louisa&rsquo;s recognition occurs &ldquo;Too Late&rdquo; for her to fully escape Harthouse. Or it could signal that the &ldquo;dawn&rdquo; of this knowledge is &ldquo;Scarcely yet&rdquo; full recognition of her &ldquo;immaterial Self&rdquo;; Louisa refers explicitly to the &ldquo;immaterial part of her life&rdquo; in her confrontation with her father after she flees both Bounderby and Harthouse in chapter 28: &ldquo;&lsquo;Would you have doomed me, at any time, to the frost and blight that have hardened and spoiled me?&nbsp; Would you have robbed me&ndash;for no one&rsquo;s enrichment&ndash;only for the greater desolation of this world&ndash;of the immaterial part of my life, the spring and summer of my belief, my refuge from what is sordid and bad in the real things around me, my school in which I should have learned to be more humble and more trusting with them, and to hope in my little sphere to make them better?&rsquo;&rdquo; (HT 240).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

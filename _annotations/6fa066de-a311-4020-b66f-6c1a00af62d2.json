The language of change, newness, and intention may lead us to connect this note with the change of direction Dickens contemplated after he wrote the first number and began the second. In a letter to Forster on August 19 he indicates that he is &ldquo;in the second number&rdquo; but is contemplating a new beginning: &ldquo;last night and this morning [I] had half a mind to begin again, and work in what I have done, afterwards&rdquo; (Forster 2.182). If Dickens wrote this note at the same time that he wrote to Forster (August 19, by Forster&rsquo;s dating), it would have been retrospectively added to the Notes <em>after</em> the composition of Number I (chapters 1-3, since chapter 4 was added later). Indeed, the mention of a &ldquo;new means of interest&rdquo; does suggest that this note pertains to Dickens&rsquo;s intention to rework the first number entirely. He went so far as to begin a re-write; on the verso of the first page of chapter 4 in the novel&rsquo;s manuscript we find a deleted heading for &ldquo;Chapter I: Mist.&rdquo; However, given the position of this note before the mems below, which, with their question about Miss Wade&rsquo;s name, suggest proactive planning, it seems unlikely that this note was added retroactively. Indeed, as Sucksmith points out in the introduction to the Clarendon edition of the novel, Dickens was already &ldquo;toying with the idea of fellow travelers, ignorant of one another, much earlier than he reported it to Forster&rdquo; (xix), since the manuscript and the Working Notes already include many references to this thematic thread. See the Critical Introduction for more on Dickens&rsquo;s interest in travelers meeting and reacting, as well as for more about Dickens&rsquo;s uncertainty in these early numbers. See LD.XI.R6 for Dickens&rsquo;s later return to this theme of travelers meeting and the &ldquo;uncertainty&rdquo; of such meetings.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There is a black/brown vertical smudge through this part of the manuscript, possibly as a result of this page of the Working Notes being reproduced for Forster&rsquo;s biography.&nbsp;</p>"

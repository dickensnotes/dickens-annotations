Although Dickens had agreed with his publishers Bradbury &amp; Evans at the outset that Hard Times would be &ldquo;equal in length to five single monthly numbers of Bleak House&rdquo; (Letters 7.911), the difficulties of the compressed space led Dickens to consider this final &lsquo;number&rsquo; as the customary &ldquo;double&rdquo; number that concluded his longer, monthly serials (as is evident by the heading to the Working Note to the right). Ultimately, this still resulted in four installments that could be published within a month, but they ran slightly longer as indicated by this note. While all of the prior weekly installments were between seven and eight &ldquo;sides&rdquo; of Dickens&rsquo;s writing in manuscript, Weekly No. 17 was nine-and-a-half manuscript pages; Weekly No. 18 was ten pages; Weekly No. 19 was nearly eleven pages; and the final installment was over 13 manuscript pages. See<em> HT.0.L1</em>, <em>HT.V-VI</em>, and the Critical Introduction for more on the challenge of the weekly serial. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

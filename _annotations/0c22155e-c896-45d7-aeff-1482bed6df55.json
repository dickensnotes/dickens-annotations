He had first tested out this idea, with some of the same language, at the beginning of his Memoranda book: &ldquo;Our house. Whatever it is, it is in a first rate situation and a fashionable neighbor hood. (Auctioneer called it &lsquo;a gentlemanly residence.&rsquo;) A series of little-closets squeezed up into the corner of a dark street&ndash;but a Duke&rsquo;s mansion round the corner. The whole house just large enough to hold a vile smell. The air breathed in at the best of times, a kind of Distillation of Mews. (Done in the Barnacles)&rdquo; (1).&nbsp;</p>"

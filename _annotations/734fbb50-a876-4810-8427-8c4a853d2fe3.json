On the one hand, the \"Slightly\" here seems to refer more to length than subtlety, as Esther's is very explicit about the love that blossoms between the two wards very early in their time at Bleak House: \"He was very, very, very fond of Ada. I mean it, and I had better say it at once. I had never seen any young people falling in love before, but I found them out quite soon\" (BH 137). On the other hand, Dickens does make an effort to temper the sense of foreboding that hangs over the courtship. A later paragraph that describes Richard's character and his care for Ada is also heavily revised in the manuscript, and in the proofs Dickens deletes a significant phrase. Esther narrates: \"I believe Richard's was as frank and generous a nature as there possibly can be. He was ardent and brave, and in the midst of all his wild restlessness, was so gentle that I knew him like a brother in a few weeks. His gentleness was natural to him and would have shown itself abundantly even without Ada's influence; but with it, he became one of the most winning of companions, always so ready to be interested and always so happy, sanguine, and light-hearted\" (BH 139-40). At the conclusion of that final sentence, Dickens deleted the parenthetical aside: \"(although there was already an indefinite shadow of separation upon us).\"</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

The woman&rsquo;s was the first reached. It was in one of the many small streets for which the favourite undertaker (who turned a handsome sum out of the one poor ghastly pomp of the neighbourhood) kept a black ladder, in order that those who had done their daily groping up and down the narrow stairs might slide out of this working world by the windows&rdquo; (HT 105).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Dickens is likely recalling something from a recent visit to Wolverhampton. Dickens had given a series of three readings to workers in Birmingham at the end of December 1853, and as part of that trip had taken a railway journey to Wolverhampton, which lies to the northwest of Birmingham. Dickens recounted this journey in a <em>Household Words</em> article called &ldquo;Fire and Snow&rdquo; in the January 21st issue. Although not the explicit basis for the novel&rsquo;s Coketown, Wolverhampton was an industrial town with a densely populated center of town, and it had experienced a particularly bad cholera outbreak in 1848. Dickens&rsquo;s article begins: &ldquo;Can this be the region of cinders and coal-dust, which we have traversed before now, divers times, both by night and by day, when the dirty wind rattled as it came against us charged with fine particles of coal, and the natural colour of the earth and all its vegetation might have been black, for anything our eyes could see to the contrary in a waste of many miles?&rdquo; (&ldquo;Fire&rdquo; 481).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

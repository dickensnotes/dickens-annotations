The chapter thus lays out the central mystery of the novel by which Little Dorrit and the Clennams will be linked and sets up Arthur&rsquo;s suspicion of a wrongdoing that he must address: &ldquo;some one may have been grievously deceived, injured, ruined&rdquo; (LD 39); &ldquo;I am haunted by a suspicion that it darkened my father&rsquo;s last hours with remorse&rdquo; (40). </span></p>"

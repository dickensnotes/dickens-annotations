The chapter numbers for No. II in both the Notes and the manuscript continue as if chapter 4 is the opening chapter number of the second installment; it is not until No. III that Dickens corrects his chapter numbers to account for the addition of this fourth chapter to No. I. On August 19, Dickens complained to Forster: &ldquo;I am in the second number, and last night and this morning had half a mind to begin again, and work in what I have done, afterwards&rdquo; (Forster 2.182). Given that the verso of the chapter&rsquo;s first manuscript page contains a page upon which he began to re-write the novel&rsquo;s opening (it reads &ldquo;Chapter I: Mist&rdquo;), it is likely that Dickens used this piece of paper first with the intention of beginning again, as he indicated to Forster, before deciding instead to add this final chapter to the number. Perhaps this sense of indecision explains why Dickens&rsquo;s pagination of the three manuscript leaves is incorrect (the middle page is inserted after the chapter&rsquo;s ending).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Indeed, Dickens experienced much hesitation throughout his composition and incorporation of this short (2.5 manuscript pages) chapter. As he began writing, he changed his mind about the identity of the dreamer, initially identifying Flintwinch himself (words crossed out include &ldquo;Jeremiah&rdquo; and five male pronouns, all emended as Dickens began writing). By the second paragraph, DIckens had changed his mind and made Affery the dreamer. He changed the title from &ldquo;Mr Flintwinch&rsquo;s dream&rdquo; to &ldquo;Mrs Flintwinch has a dream.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the proof stage, Dickens evidently considered another change. As chapter IV begins in proof, the first section (about a third of a page) is crossed out, but then a &ldquo;stet&rdquo; is added in the margins and the proof continues. Later, Dickens considered moving the chapter entirely. As he wrote No. III and made the decision to split the novel into two books (Poverty and Wealth), Dickens considered briefly the idea of moving this whole chapter to No. IV in order to make room in No. I for a title page. He wrote to Bradbury &amp; Evans on October 29: &ldquo;I can get the space out of No. I, by taking away the last short chapter and putting it into No. IV, where it will come as well&rdquo; (Letters 7.729). This is perhaps why the proof for chapter IV has the first section (about a third of a page) crossed out, with a &ldquo;stet&rdquo; added in the margins to indicate a change of mind. As Herring points out, &ldquo;Fortunately, this [movement of the chapter] was not necessary because such a change would intertwine the fates of Clennam and Little Dorrit far too late in the novel.v&nbsp; In addition, the secret alluded to in chapter iv provides the backbone for much of the story and had to be suggested early&rdquo; (30). Notably, there are two extant corrected proofs for chapter IV. Perhaps, as Sucksmith suggests, this is because Dickens marked up a second version of the proofs for this chapter when he considered moving it to Number IV (xxii).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Brattin will use the hasty addition of this chapter, and Dickens aborted decision to relocate it, as evidence for his claim that &ldquo;Dickens was clutching for a plot, and that he did <em>not</em> plan it out in advance&rdquo; (113). Brattin points out that nowhere in the manuscript or the Notes does Dickens indicate what is inside the box that Ephraim takes from the house: &ldquo;It seems all too likely that he had not even determined the contents of it for himself at the time of original serial publication&rdquo; (113).&nbsp;</p>"

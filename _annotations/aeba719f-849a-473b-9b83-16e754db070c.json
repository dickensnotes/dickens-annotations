The similarity in this language to a letter written after the chapter&rsquo;s composition may suggest that the note is retroactive.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Dickens refers here to John Sadlier, the infamous Irisih politician and financier who committed suicide on Hampstead Heath in mid-February after the failure of his speculations, which involved forged shares in the Royal Swedish Railway Company and an overdraft on the Tipperary Bank. Dickens makes explicit reference in his preface to this inspiration for his &ldquo;extravagant conception&rdquo; of Mr. Merdle (LD lix). Given that there is no mention of Mr. Merdle in the left-hand memoranda, it may be the case that Dickens decided to include this storyline only while he was in the process of composing the number.</p>"

That narrative occurred before Tattycoram&rsquo;s appearance and Clennam&rsquo;s subsequent return to England, which concluded the chapter. Dickens was dissatisfied with the narrative strategy of &ldquo;containing&rdquo; Miss Wade&rsquo;s story within this chapter; he discussed the matter with Forster and followed up with the following letter:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the practicability of making the History of a Self-Tormentor, with which I took great pains, a written narrative. But I do see the possibility&hellip; of making it a chapter by itself, which might enable me to dispense with the necessity of the turned commas. Do you think that would be better? I have no doubt that a great part of Fielding&rsquo;s reason for the introduced story, and Smollett&rsquo;s, also, was, that it is sometimes really impossible to present, in a full book, the idea it contains (which yet it may be on all accounts desirable to present), without supposing the reader to be possessed of almost as much romantic allowance as would put him on a level with the writer. In Miss Wade I had an idea, which I thought a new one, of making the introduced story so fit into surroundings impossible of separation from the main story, as to make the blood of the book circulate through both. But I can only suppose, from what you say, that I have not exactly succeeded in this. (Forster 2.184-85)&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Herring aptly describes Dickens&rsquo;s acquiescence to Forster&rsquo;s suggestion as &ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo;: &ldquo;When Dickens divided chapter xx, he not only lost the opportunity of fully exploiting the dramatic irony of her narration but also created the rather artificial circumstance of her having written out her life expressly for Clennam&rsquo;s perusal&rdquo; (52). By cutting out the middle part of the chapter, Dickens was forced to conclude chapter 20 with Clennam&rsquo;s departure before he (or the reader) has read her story, a change that also reduces the impact of Clennam&rsquo;s brief conversation with Tattycoram and recognition of the anger between the two women (see LD.XVI.R12). As Alistair Duckworth puts it, &ldquo;The chapter has a curious and somewhat awkward place in the novel,&rdquo; even if it is &ldquo;thematically appropriate&rdquo; (110).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although Forster misdates the letter Dickens sent him about this alteration (see Letters 8.279fn5), we can date the &ldquo;change&rdquo; to this number to early February based on what we know of Dickens&rsquo;s identification of his error in misnaming Blandois as Rigaud as he was working on this number (February 5).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The surviving proofs are for the original version; the altered proofs have not survived.</p>"

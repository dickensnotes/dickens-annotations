While Mrs. Clennam will not utter these words, chapter 30 will feature Flintwinch summarizing the meaning of Do No Forget: &ldquo;Make restitution!&rdquo; (LD 760). Mrs. Clennam will describe Gilbert Clennam as being &ldquo;reduced to imbecility&rdquo; and in a &ldquo;state of weakness&rdquo; in making his will (756).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That Mrs. Clennam does not speak a version of the words &ldquo;I will make restitution when I see fit&rdquo; suggests a change of plan as Dickens composed chapter 30. Mrs. Clennam sees no need for &ldquo;restitution,&rdquo; instead emphasizing the sin committed by her husband and his lover: &ldquo;It was a rewarding of sin; the wrong result of a delusion&rdquo; (LD 758). Instead of indicating that she &ldquo;will find it, one day,&rdquo; Mrs. Clennam admits that she &ldquo;could&hellip; have made a pretence of finding it,&rdquo; but that she chose not to do so: &ldquo;I have seen no new reason, in all the time I have been tried here, to bring it to light.&rdquo;</p>"

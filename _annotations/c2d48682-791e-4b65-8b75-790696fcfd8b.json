The elopement is carefully intimated throughout, particularly by the conversation between David, Steerforth, and Miss Mowcher (\"I swear she was born to be a lady\"), but the number is significantly bookended by both Steerforth and Emily&rsquo;s &ldquo;misgivings.&rdquo; The Working Note shows that their separate misgivings are connected, but Dickens removed a passage, sometime after the first set of proofs, that made this association explicit. Although, in chapter 23, David chooses not to tell Steerforth about Emily&rsquo;s distress, the manuscript originally had him relate &ldquo;what had passed with Martha,&rdquo; and described Steerforth&rsquo;s response: &ldquo;He listened to that recital in perfect silence, and was evidently moved by it. I thought it moved him to a kind of dread, like that I had observed in him last night, more than to pity; but it did move him, and strongly too\" (Clarendon 291.n3).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

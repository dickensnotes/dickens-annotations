Of which remarkable gentlewoman it may be finally observed, that there surely never was a gentlewoman of whose transcendent fitness for any vacant appointment on the face of this earth, so many people were (as the warmth of her Testimonials evinced) so perfectly satisfied&mdash;or who was so very unfortunate in having a large circle of ardent and distinguished admirers, who never themselves happened to want her in any capacity&rdquo; (LD 781). Dickens&rsquo;s initial answer to the implied question of the character&rsquo;s inclusion is an affirmative, but he then elaborates on how the narrative will deal with her character&rsquo;s fate, writing over the initial &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; with this detail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"

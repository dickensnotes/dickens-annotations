Gone</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The left-hand questions for three numbers indicate that Dickens planned carefully for the gradual progression of Clennam&rsquo;s downfall. In No. XIV he answers in the affirmative to &ldquo;Begin Clennam&rsquo;s course downward?&rdquo; (LD.XIV.L3), activating this question in his chapter note: &ldquo;Foreshadow Clennam&rsquo;s loss, through Pancks&rsquo;s persuasion&rdquo; (LD.XIV.R12). In the previous number, XVI, he asks &ldquo;Take Clennam and his fortunes?&rdquo; and answers &ldquo;Carry through&rdquo; (LD.XVI.L2), deferring the &ldquo;taking&rdquo; of the fortunes to this number. According to Herring, the answer to the question posed in this note &ldquo;suggests that Dickens had intended another picture of Clennam gradually succumbing to the fever of speculation&rdquo; (54); he answers &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; and then modifies the tense of &ldquo;going&rdquo; to &ldquo;Gone.&rdquo; This original intention is consistent with Dickens&rsquo;s note about Merdle&rsquo;s &ldquo;smashed&rdquo; reputation in the next number (see LD.XVIII.L2).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Notably, Dickens picks up this same language (&ldquo;going downward&rdquo;) in the chapter notes for the next number (XVIII) in reference not to Clennam&rsquo;s financial affairs, but to his spirits: &ldquo;Drooping Downward&rdquo; (LD.XVIII.R6) and &ldquo;Ever downward, always downward&rdquo; (LD.XVIII.R14). When we first encounter Clennam in this number (XVII, chapter 26), he has his &ldquo;head down on the desk&rdquo; (LD 692); the &ldquo;Bleeding Hearts&rdquo; notice that Clennam is &ldquo;pulled down by&rdquo; his reverse of fortune (698). See LD.XVIII.R6 for Dickens&rsquo;s use of the language of &ldquo;downward&rdquo; in that Note.</p>"

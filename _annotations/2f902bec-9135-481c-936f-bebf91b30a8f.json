On the 18th of April, Dickens wrote to W.H. Wills on Household Words business and personal matters. Under the heading &ldquo;C.D.&rdquo; (referring to himself), Dickens wrote: &ldquo;I am in a dreary state, planning and planning the story of Hard Times (out of materials for I don&rsquo;t know how long a story), and consequently writing little&rdquo; (Letters 7.317). Dickens explains that while he had hoped to come to Worcester the following week with Mark Lemon and to meet with Wills there, &ldquo;I am now afraid I shall not be able to spare the day.&rdquo; The editors of Dickens&rsquo;s letters speculate that Dickens might have been planning weekly installments 7 and 8 (chapter 13-16) at this time. Weekly installment No. 5 appeared in <em>Household Words</em> on the 29th of April, and the following three installments appeared on the first three Saturdays of the following month (May 6th, 13th, and 20th).&nbsp; </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

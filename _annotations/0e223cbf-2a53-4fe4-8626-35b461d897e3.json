Arthur goes on to describe his father&rsquo;s death: &ldquo;Remember, I saw his face when he gave the watch into my keeping, and struggled to express that he sent it as a token you would understand, to you. Remember, I saw him at the last with the pencil in his failing hand, trying to write some word for you to read, but to which he could give no shape&rdquo; (47).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The &ldquo;old-fashioned gold watch in a heavy double case&rdquo; is first mentioned in No. I, chapter 3, when Clennam describes his father&rsquo;s &ldquo;anxiety&rdquo; about the watch&rsquo;s delivery to Mrs. Clennam. He describes the watch case that his father had struggled to open before his death: &ldquo;I opened it myself, thinking there might be for anything I knew, some memorandum there. However, as I need not tell you, mother, there was nothing but the old silk watch-paper worked in beads, which you found (no doubt) in its place between the cases, where I found and left it&rdquo; (LD 35).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />Dickens conflates multiple chapters here. There is no mention in these early numbers of the inscription; this will appear in chapter 30 (No. IX) when Rigaud describes the watch: &ldquo;An old silk watch-lining, worked with beads!&rdquo; he remarks &ldquo;Extraordinary how they used to complicate these cyphers&hellip; Now is this D. N. F.? It might be almost anything&rdquo; (LD 349). Mrs. Clennam confirms that the words &ldquo;have always stood, I believe, for Do Not Forget!&rdquo; (350). It was at this point in the Notes that Dickens reminded himself to &ldquo;Suspend it all. Hanging Sword&rdquo; (LD.IX.R2).</p>",

In that scene, as she expresses &ldquo;an interest&rdquo; in Little Dorrit, we see Mrs. Clennam &ldquo;looking towards the watch, once her dead husband&rsquo;s, which always lay upon her table.&rdquo; Affery overhears this interchange: &ldquo;In all the dreams Mistress Affery had been piling up since she first became devoted to the pursuit, she had dreamed nothing more astonishing than this.&rdquo; Dickens began to write this same summary, in the same language, on his previous page of retrospective notes (see LD.Mems1.L7), but changed his mind, instead starting a new page to continue his summary of material from the same chapter he had been summarizing in the prior note. Presumably, then, he realized as he first wrote a version of this summary that he needed another page on which to complete his retrospective notes. </span></p>"

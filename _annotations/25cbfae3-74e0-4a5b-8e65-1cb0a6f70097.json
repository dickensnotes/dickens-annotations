There is no direct mention of the charwoman Bangham in Maggy&rsquo;s introduction. In the manuscript, Maggy&rsquo;s first introduction appears as an interlineated insertion above an illegibly erased name. When Little Dorrit first introduces Clennam to Maggy, Dickens has initially written what appears to be &ldquo;Maggy Flinx,&rdquo; which would be consistent with Mrs. Bangham&rsquo;s name in the initial draft of No. II (see LD.II.R9). &ldquo;Flinx&rdquo; is crossed out and &ldquo;Bangham&rdquo; is written as Maggy&rsquo;s surname above, but this too is crossed out in favor of giving Maggy just a first name, emphasizing her orphan status and making her relationship with her&nbsp; &ldquo;Little Mother&rdquo; all the more poignant.</p>"

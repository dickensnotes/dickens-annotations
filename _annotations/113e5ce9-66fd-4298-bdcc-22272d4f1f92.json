While this is accomplished primarily through his influence on Richard and his connection to Vholes, his actions and behaviour are not substantially different from how he has appeared in the novel to this point. At the same time, Esther does comment explicitly on her growing discomfort with Skimpole: \"I thought I could understand how such a nature as my guardian's, experienced in the world, and forced to contemplate the miserable evasions and contentions of the family misfortune, found an immense relief in Mr Skimpole's avowal of his weaknesses and display of guileless candour; but I could not satisfy myself that it was as artless as it seemed; or that it did not serve Mr Skimpole's idle turn quite as well as any other part, and with less trouble\" (BH 594).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

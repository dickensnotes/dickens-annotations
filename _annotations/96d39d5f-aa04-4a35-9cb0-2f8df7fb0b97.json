Firstly, the memorandum implicitly compares Agnes to a 'false' heroine: this could potentially refer to Little Em'ly, who has featured prominently to this point in the novel, but it is also likely that Dickens was already preparing for the introduction of Dora Spenlow in No. IX. Dora's character was based on the object of his own early infatuation, Maria Beadnell who, incidentally, appeared again in Dickens's work, in a very different form, in Little Dorrit's Flora Finching.&nbsp;</span><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ba1acb6c-7fff-f1f2-0df1-c8388b127a3e\"></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Second, and perhaps more importantly, the note also illustrates Dickens's confident decision about the role Agnes was to play. Despite this, however, his later indecision about Dora's death may suggest he was not entirely certain about the exact nature of this heroism, and whether he would have David and Agnes married by the end of the novel (see <em>DC.XIV.L1</em> for more on Dickens&rsquo;s handling of Dora as the novel progressed).</span></p>"

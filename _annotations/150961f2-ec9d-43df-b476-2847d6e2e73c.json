Having recently returned from Paris, with memories of his recent travels on the Continent fresh in his mind, Dickens was clearly drawing on his own travels in his ideas for this new novel. His decision to open the novel with travelers returning from the East in this town of transnational trade indicates his interest in a broad geographical scope. As Amanda Anderson has noted, this is &ldquo;the most cosmopolitan of Dickens&rsquo;s novels in terms of setting&rdquo; (67).</p>"

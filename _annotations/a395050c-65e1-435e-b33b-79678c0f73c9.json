It should be a very fine point in the story&rdquo; (Forster 2.183).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />This chapter (and the number as a whole) will &ldquo;pave the way&rdquo; via Pancks&rsquo;s information-gathering and &ldquo;fortune telling&rdquo;), but Pancks&rsquo;s presence also connects back to the shadow motif from the previous number; he appears in the number as Clennam is musing on &ldquo;his old doubts in reference to his mother and Little Dorrit&rdquo;: &ldquo;Mr Pancks cast his shadow through the glass upon the books and papers&rdquo; (LD 268). </p>"

Dickens may have written this chapter title and notes after he had started the chapter, though the nature of the notes themselves appears proactive, perhaps indicating that he used the notes to think through the completion of a chapter he had already started to write.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Dickens appears to have written this chapter after he sent the previous three to the printers, since the first proof ends at chapter 28 (see Sucksmith xxx). The chapter notes constitute a different layer than the ones for both chapter 28 and those for chapters 26 and 27.</p>"

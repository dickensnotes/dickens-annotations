It is via her own voice that Dickens is able to present her character as &ldquo;Vindictive and with her heart full of [hatred] raging hatred&rdquo; (LD.XIX-XXMems2.R8): &ldquo;I will tell it myself! I will not hear it from your lips, and with the taint of your wickedness upon it&hellip;. Hear me!&rdquo; (LD752). Although he emphasizes the importance of this narrative strategy by underlining this planning note, Dickens had such difficulty composing this part of the manuscript introducing her decision to take over the story that he had to rewrite the section and paste it over his original draft (see LD.XIX-XX.R1).</span></p>"

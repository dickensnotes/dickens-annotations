Doyce insists that he will not discuss such matters: &ldquo;all rests with you&rdquo;; he merely expresses a &ldquo;prejudice&hellip; against speculating,&rdquo; which Clennam will recast as a rejection of all but &ldquo;safe investments&rdquo; (LD 653). With this conversation recalling Pancks&rsquo;s advice that Clennam invest with Mr. Merdle, the number will &ldquo;carry through&rdquo; this thread. It was perhaps as he contemplated Clennam&rsquo;s losses that Dickens decided to &ldquo;Get Doyce away on his expedition&rdquo; (see LD.XVI.R15).</p>"

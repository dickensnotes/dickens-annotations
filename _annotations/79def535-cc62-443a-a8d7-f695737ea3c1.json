Cavaletto rises before Rigaud/Lanier, creeps downstairs, and wants only to &ldquo;run away&rdquo; (LD 129). The &ldquo;sunrise picture&rdquo; to which the note refers, along with the &ldquo;red light&rdquo; and the &ldquo;long road,&rdquo; corresponds directly to the final sentences of the chapter: &ldquo;When the sun had raised his full disc above the flat line of the horizon, and was striking fire out of the long muddy vista of the paved road with its weary avenue of little tries, a black speck moved along the road and splashed among the flaming pools of rain-water, which black speck was John Baptist Cavalletto running away from his patron&rdquo; (LD 129).</p>"

The first mention of the character has her name written &ldquo;General Varnisher,&rdquo; with both names crossed out and &ldquo;General&rdquo; added above. The second instance has &ldquo;Mrs Varnisher&rdquo; with &ldquo;Varnisher&rdquo; erased and &ldquo;General&rdquo; added directly afterwards. Subsequent uses have abandoned &ldquo;Varnisher.&rdquo; While it is difficult to know for certain whether Dickens originally intended for both words to be part of her name, we might suppose that he originally wrote &ldquo;Mrs General&rdquo; in the first instance, erased it and changed it to &ldquo;Mrs Varnisher,&rdquo; but then changed his mind on the second instance and returned to &ldquo;General,&rdquo; returning to the first instance and changing the name back to his original. If this is the case, the memoranda in this Note may still be prospective.&nbsp;</p>"

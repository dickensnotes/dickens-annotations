On the 1st of May he wrote to Frank Stone that he was trying to complete No. IV and that it was \"rather a stunner\" (Letters 6.655). Although the chapter memoranda for this number remain sparse, Dickens seems to have felt confident in the novel's opening numbers and was buoyed by initial strong sales. In a letter to Lavinia Watson, Dickens confided: \"Five and thirty thousand, every publishing day, is the present mark of Bleak House, thank God!\" (Letters 6.666). In a longer letter to William F. De Cerjat on the 8th of May he expressed how he \"look[s] forward to good things whereof the foundations are built\" (Letters 6.670) and credited the strong sales to the success of <em>Copperfield</em>: \"[Bleak House] is a most enormous success; all the prestige of Copperfield (which was very great) [is] telling upon it, and raising its circulation above all my other books.\"</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

There is some distinction between the chapter headings and the notes themselves (the headings are sharper), suggesting they were written at different times, potentially with a different nib. Several of the chapter titles appear more similar to the headings that the notes below&mdash;chapters 58, 59 and 61 appear most distinctly different. As with the previous four Working Notes, the main heading is in black ink, indicating that Dickens probably headed up the last Notes well in advance. This may have happened prior to the switch to blue ink in the manuscript for No. XVII (see </span><em><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">DC.XIII</span></em><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">).</span><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-3ecb2080-7fff-2719-a3a2-805ec074d47d\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">There appear to be two clear layers of ink on the left-hand side of the Working Note. The majority of the notes down to \"Mr and Miss Murdstone\" appear to have been made along with the other proactive notes written prior to No. XVI (see </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><em>DC.XVI</em> </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">and Critical Introduction), the exception being Dickens's response to the memorandum about Uriah (\"No. Change that...\"), the inclusion of Peggotty, Emily, and the Micawbers just below, and the list of chapters in the box to the right. These, along with all the entries below, are in the same soft blue ink that is used on the right-hand page. In this later layer of light blue it sees that Dickens added a question mark to the memorandum about Mr. Mell, presumably uncertain how to reintroduce this character after an interval of fifteen months.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The reminder to reintroduce Julia Mills is the only note that appears to be made at a completely different time to the others. It is similar in color to the second layer of notes, but notably sharper, not unlike the chapter headings on the right-hand side.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Regardless of the exact timing of the layers, the Working Note clearly shows a four-stage planning process. First, Dickens blocked out the major elements of the chapter in varying levels of detail. These memoranda pertain to David's travels, Traddles's married life, Uriah's conduct in prison, David and Agnes's marriage, and the situation of the emigrants. Second, he wrote up a list of associated minor characters and motifs \"to bring up.\" Though not directly related to the major story events outlined above, these threads still needed to be tied up. Fascinatingly, they appear on the list in rough order of their appearance earlier in the novel, and so Dickens may have worked through previous numbers (or even Working Notes) systematically in order to remind himself of the characters to revisit. With these major and minor elements in mind, the third stage involved their allocation into chapters and the drafted order of these chapters. In the final pass over the Note, Dickens finalized the chapter order in the box on the center-right of the page. </span></p>",

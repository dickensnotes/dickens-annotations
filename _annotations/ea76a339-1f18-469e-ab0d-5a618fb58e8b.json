Yes</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-fadacc92-7fff-afdc-3acc-dd864622f2a4\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Marseilles quarantine in which we find the Meagles and Arthur Clennam is paired with the prison in chapter 1, establishing the theme of imprisonment from the novel&rsquo;s opening. The prison has its &ldquo;taint on everything&rdquo;: &ldquo;The imprisoned air, the imprisoned light, the imprisoned damps, the imprisoned men, were all deteriorated by confinement&rdquo; (LD 2). Chapter 2 will suggest that the tainting air of imprisonment continues. Mr. Meagles bemoans the imprisonment of quarantine: &ldquo;I am like a sane man shut up in a madhouse; I can&rsquo;t stand the suspicion of the thing&rdquo; (15). Just as the prisoners are described as &ldquo;birds&rdquo; by the jailor (6), Mr. Meagles describes the English travelers in quarantine as &ldquo;jail-birds&rdquo; about to &ldquo;take wing for our different destinations&rdquo; (16). &ldquo;I dare say a prisoner begins to relent towards his prison, after he is let out,&rdquo; reflects Mr. Meagles as he leaves the quarantine (21).</p>"

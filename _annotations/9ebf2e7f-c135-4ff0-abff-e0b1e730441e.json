While the reader is familiar with the legend from the repeated references to it in the third-person narration, Esther herself must become aware of it in order to make this connection. Dickens accomplishes this briefly early in the chapter by having Esther introduce the legend: \"A picturesque part of the Hall, called The Ghosh's Walk, was seen to advantage from this higher ground; and the startling name, and the old legend in the Dedlock family which I had heard from Mr Boythorn, accounting for it, mingled with the view and gave it something of a mysterious interest, in addition to its real charms\" (BH 576).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

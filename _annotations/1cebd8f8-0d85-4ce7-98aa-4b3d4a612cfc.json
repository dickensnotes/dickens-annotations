As Harry Stone and others have documented, Dickens had originally planned for three chapters in this opening number, before inserting this short second chapter and renumbering the following chapters. This renumbering also appears in the manuscript. As H.P. Sucksmith explains, the insertion of this chapter occurred after the other three chapters had been composed (since in the manuscript, chapters II and III are altered to III and IV, respectively), but before he began composition of No. II, which begins in the manuscript with chapter V (64). The chapter heading and title for chapter 2 are in a darker ink and appear to have been added to the note later (along with the third&nbsp; stroke added to make \"chapter II\" into \"chapter III,\" as well as the deletion of \"III\" and the substitution of \"IV\" below\").</span></p>",

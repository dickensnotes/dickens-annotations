Sometime in late May or early June 1850, prior to the composition of No. XVI, Dickens apparently prepared the final four Working Notes by sketching out the major events to come in each number. These memoranda, which all look to be written in the same dark blue ink of Nos. XII-XV (rather than the black ink used for No.XVI), encompass Emily&rsquo;s discovery and Dora&rsquo; illness (here, on DC_WN_16); Dora&rsquo;s mysterious conversation with Agnes, her death, and the downfall of Uriah Heep (on DC_WN_17); the emigration, the tempest, and David&rsquo;s departure for Switzerland (on DC_WN_18); and Uriah&rsquo;s imprisonment, Traddles&rsquo;s domestic happiness, and David&rsquo;s marriage to Agnes (on DC_WN_19). When working on the corresponding installments Dickens returned to emend and respond to these memoranda on the Working Notes, resulting in a number of distinctly layered Notes (see the Critical Introduction for more). </span><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-cdd1ef5d-7fff-25ae-5b7a-5e5b18f76bbc\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">No. XVI is one of only three four-chapter installments in <em>David Copperfield</em>, but unlike Nos. X and XVIII, there is some evidence that it was planned as a four-chapter installment from the time that Dickens prepared the Working Note. The spacing of the chapter headings on the right-hand side is reasonably even, and Dickens&rsquo;s initial mislabelling of chapter 49 may have simply been a mistake. It is also possible that this heading originally referred to chapter 48, but that Dickens changed his mind at some point and added the second chapter heading above. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Splitting the number into four chapters allowed Dickens to neatly address his major subplots since, at this critical juncture, each of the novel&rsquo;s story threads needed to be advanced toward its conclusion. The topic of the first chapter had been prescribed by the conclusion of No. XV, and Dickens decided to end the number with Emily's discovery, leaving the middle chapters to describe David and Dora&rsquo;s married life and the growing intrigue in Canterbury, respectively (with both chapters preparing for important developments in No. XVII). </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">While the manuscript for No. XVI is written in black ink (excluding the title and first chapter heading), both blue and black inks appear on the Working Note. The first layer of notes on the left-hand side are in the same homogeneous shade of dark blue as the Working Notes for Nos. XII-XV, while the entries on the right-hand page, and the responses and late additions on the left, are in black.</span></p>"

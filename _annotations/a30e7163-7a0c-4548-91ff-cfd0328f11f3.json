Dickens, however, offers an alternative legend that resonates with his imprisonment theme, a &ldquo;love-lorn song&rdquo; sung by a young lady who had been &ldquo;imprisoned in her chamber by a cruel father for remaining true to her own true love, and refusing to marry the suitor he chose for her&rdquo; LD (129-130). Dickens ends this chapter by connecting Bleeding Heart Yard with the Circumlocution Office and the theme of finding no one to blame: &ldquo;As to who was to blame for [the poverty and lack of work], Mr. Plornish didn&rsquo;t know who was to blame for it&rdquo; (LD 136).</p>"

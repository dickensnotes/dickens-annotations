This suggests that the chapter numbers and titles were added to the Note contemporaneously, before the addition of chapter note content. However, in the manuscript, this title is squeezed in between the chapter number heading and the opening line of text. While this may have been an attempt to save space, in many instances it appears that Dickens inserted titles after beginning to write a chapter. If this is the case here, it is possible that Dickens composed these chapters before he wrote the content for each chapter note in the Working Note for this number.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The phrase &ldquo;Little Mother&rdquo; was perhaps Dickens&rsquo;s inspiration for adding the &ldquo;Little&rdquo; to Dorrit&rsquo;s name, since it is after this point that Dickens begins occasionally writing &ldquo;Little Dorrit&rdquo; in the manuscript (See LD.III.R4 and Butt &amp; Tillotson 231). The addition of &ldquo;Little&rdquo; to Dorrit&rsquo;s name at this point in Dickens&rsquo;s composition might also have been related to Dickens&rsquo;s focus, via Clennam&rsquo;s observation, on her diminutive size and childlike appearance: &ldquo;The little creature seemed so young in his eyes, that there were moments when he found himself thinking of her, if not speaking to her, as if she were a child&rdquo; (LD 79). In the next number, in chapter 14, Little Dorrit will say to Maggy that &ldquo;Little Dorrit&rdquo; and &ldquo;Little Mother&rdquo; are &ldquo;all the same&rdquo;&nbsp; (161).</p>"

Beginning with the sixth number, the question/answer mode is the dominant mode Dickens works in on the left-hand side of the Working Notes. This makes a great deal of sense: if Dickens used the mode to manage the increasingly complex elements of his plots, then it would have become increasingly useful as Copperfield introduced readers to a greater number of subplots and characters. Toward the end of the serial run, too, Dickens had to maintain especially careful control over the pacing of his narrative, and the question/answer mode allowed him to condense the necessary events into an ever-narrowing number of available pages. Paying attention to the proportion of acceptance, rejection, and deferral on the Working Notes offers a glimpse not only into Dickens's intentions for each installment, but also into the unique challenges they presented.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Dickens's reliance on the question/answer mode indicates the substantial level of discipline demanded by the serial novel form. The Working Notes facilitated the management of these demands, and Dickens's careful negotiation of two opposing compulsions: creative excess and disciplined restraint (see the Scholarly Introduction for more). Dickens expressed something of this tension in a letter of January 1849, just before he began <em>David Copperfield</em>: \"The process of my mind in the construction of such a picture as the opening one of twilight [in <em>The Haunted Man</em>] is one incessant process of <em>rejection</em>. I bring it down to that, by working at it very slowly, and with infinite pains&mdash;rejecting things, day after day, as they come into my thoughts, and whipping the cream of them\" (Letters 5.466, emphasis original). </span></p>"

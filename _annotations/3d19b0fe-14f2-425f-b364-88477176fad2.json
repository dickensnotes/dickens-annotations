In her first conversation with Mr. Meagles, she establishes her implacability and bitterness against constraint: &ldquo;If I had been shut up in any place to pine and suffer, I should always hate that place and wish to burn it down, or raze it to the ground&rdquo; (22). Dickens imagines her face telling its own tale: &ldquo;I am self-contained and self-reliant; your opinion is nothing to me; I have no interest in you, care nothing for you, and see and hear you with indifference&rdquo; (23).</p>"

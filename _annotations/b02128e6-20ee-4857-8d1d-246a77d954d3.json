In Forster&rsquo;s biographical account, it was during this period (1854 and later) where Dickens first recognized and articulated a sense that his marriage had been a failure: &ldquo;During his absences abroad for the greater part of 1854, &lsquo;55, and &lsquo;56, while elder of his children were growing out of childhood, and his books were less easy to him than in his earlier manhood, evidences presented themselves in his letters of the old &lsquo;unhappy loss or want of something&rsquo; to which he had given a pervading prominence in Copperfield. In the first of those years he made express allusion to the kind of experience which had been one of his descriptions in that favourite book, and, mentioning the drawbacks of his present life, had first identified it with his own: &lsquo;the so happy and yet so unhappy existence which seeks its realities in unrealities, and finds its dangerous comfort in a perpetual escape from the disappointment of heart around it&rsquo;&rdquo; (Forster 2.196).&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">At the time of the novel&rsquo;s publication, the only way to obtain a divorce was by special petition and a private Act of Parliament. This required both demonstrable cause (adultery or cruelty) as well as considerable expense, as Bounderby explains to Stephen in chapter 11: &ldquo;&lsquo;Why, you&rsquo;d have to go to Doctors&rsquo; Commons with a suit, and you&rsquo;d have to go to a court of Common Law with a suit, and you&rsquo;d have to go to the House of Lords with a suit, and you&rsquo;d have to get an Act of Parliament to enable you to marry again, and it would cost you (if it was a case of very plain-sailing), I suppose from a thousand to fifteen hundred pound&rsquo;&rdquo; (HT 113). This would change with the passing of the Matrimonial Causes Act in 1857, which moved litigation of divorce from the ecclesiastical courts to civil courts (sufficient grounds were still required). In 1853, a Royal Commission had recommended a review of jurisdiction on the matter, and in June of 1854 (midway through the serial run of Hard Times), a Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Bill was introduced to the House of Lords, where it was debated but not passed. According to John Baird, Dickens&rsquo;s engagement with the question of marriage laws during this period focuses both on the prohibitive cost as well as on the human suffering caused by the system. This is seen both in <em>Hard Times</em> as well as in a series of articles focusing on marriage in <em>Household Words</em>, beginning with Eliza Lynn Linton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rights and Wrongs of Women,&rdquo; which appeared in the April 1, 1854 issue alongside the opening installment of the novel. See Baird, Butt &amp; Tillotson (pp. 210-211), and Hager for further discussions of Dickens and divorce. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

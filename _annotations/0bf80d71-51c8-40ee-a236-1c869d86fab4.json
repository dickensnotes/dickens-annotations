However, their union is incorporated into the conclusion of&nbsp; the novel by being integrated into George's reunion with his brother, as his return and their betrothal occur on the same day. As Mr Rouncewell explains, \"This is a great day at home, and you could not have arrived, you bronzed old soldier, on a better. I make an agreement with my son Watt to-day, that on this day twelve-month he shall marry as pretty and as good a girl as you have seen in all your travels. She goes to Germany to-morrow, with one of your nieces, for a little polishing up in her education. we make a feast of the event, and you will be made the hero of it\" (BH 954).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

While the memoranda on the left-hand side clearly indicate that this &ldquo;new state&rdquo; is a foil to Dora&rsquo;s lack of progress, David&rsquo;s decision to learn shorthand and become a parliamentary reporter also paves the way for his publication of \"a good many trifling pieces&rdquo; (DC 633), and his eventual recognition as a successful novelist.&nbsp;</span><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-4e10b25d-7fff-b534-c87c-f54f7bd92370\"></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">David's professional career in the novel is closely aligned to Dickens&rsquo;s own experiences. In his biography, Forster describes Dickens \"set[ting] resolutely [...] to the study of shorthand\" in order to enter the gallery as a journalist (1.45). \"Of all the difficulties that beset his shorthand studies,\" Forster wrote, \"as well as of what first turned his mind to them, he has told also something in <em>Copperfield</em>. He had heard that many men distinguished in various pursuits had begun life by reporting the debates in parliament, and he was not deterred by a friend's warning that the mere mechanical accomplishment for excellence in it might take a few years to master thoroughly\" (1.45-6). As Forster recognized, the detail of these testimonies is easily discernible in Traddles's warning that \"the mere mechanical acquisition necessary, except in rare cases, for [...] a perfect and entire command of the mystery of short-hand writing and reading, was about equal in difficulty to the mastery of six languages; and that it might perhaps be attained, by dint of perseverance, in the course of a few years\" (DC 533). The two years Dickens was forced to spend as a shorthand writer for the proctors at Doctor's Commons before becoming \"a sharer in parliamentary toils and triumphs\" are, of course, mirrored in David's being articled as a proctor to Spenlow &amp; Jorkins (Forster 2.46). Dickens finally entered the gallery at the age of nineteen (Forster 1.49); David &ldquo;tame[s] that savage stenographic mystery\" (DC 632) by twenty-one, and is distinguished as a parliamentary reporter in No. XIV. </span></p>",

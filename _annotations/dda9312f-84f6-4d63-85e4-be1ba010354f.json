The reference here is to chapter 4 of the opening number. In his analysis of the manuscript changes to chapter 4, Joel J. Brattin points out that Dickens never hints at the contents of the iron box: &ldquo;It seems all too likely that he had not even determined the contents of it for himself at the time of original serial publication&hellip; In fact, there is no reason to suspect that Dickens worked out the contents of the iron box until he began to work on the final double number&rdquo; (113).</p>"

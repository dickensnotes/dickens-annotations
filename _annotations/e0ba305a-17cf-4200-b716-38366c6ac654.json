And [...]</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Dickens only offers one short list of questions and a single &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the left-hand page for this Note, indicating that he was fairly certain at this stage what needed to be accomplished to complete the first book.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The &ldquo;Flora? Casby?&rdquo; questions appear smaller and in a slightly darker ink, indented between the first list of names relating to Society (marked off by a dash) and the next item: &ldquo;Pet&rsquo;s marriage.&rdquo; Dickens presumably recognized the need to return to these characters before closing Book I; he would use Flora as the means by which Clennam would reveal Little Dorrit&rsquo;s fortune to her, and Casby would appear in the Yard upon the Dorrits&rsquo; departure.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite the separation between items in this list implied by non-textual markings and spacing, Dickens groups them together with an emphatic &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Pet&rsquo;s marriage, the only item in this list without a question mark, acts in part as an answer to the questions above, since the marriage provides the occasion for Society, with its &ldquo;Shoal of Barnacles,&rdquo; to gather.</p>"

From End of Last chapter.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With this note, Dickens indicates that this chapter will pick up where the previous one ended, which is indeed the case. Where chapter 31 concludes with Mr. Dorrit&rsquo;s departure so that Clennam can speak with Little Dorrit, chapter 32 opens with that conversation. Where chapter 31 closes with a mention of Maggy&rsquo;s presence, chapter 32 begins with a description of Maggy sitting at her work. The phrasing suggests that Dickens had already composed the previous chapter&rsquo;s ending before he wrote this chapter note.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The appearance of the opening of this chapter in the manuscript may even suggest that Dickens wrote the very first phrase of the chapter (&ldquo;Maggy sat at her work&rdquo;) before pausing work, perhaps giving himself a convenient stopping point that indicated continuation from the last chapter. While there is no clear way of determining temporality, the ink used for this opening phrase in the manuscript appears consistent with that used at the end of the previous chapter, and the size of the words changes after this opening phrase, which may suggest that Dickens picked up work on the chapter in a new sitting.&nbsp;</p>"

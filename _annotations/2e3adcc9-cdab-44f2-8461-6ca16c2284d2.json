That the numbers are correct in the Note indicates that they were entered here after composition.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the proofs, there are notes to the printer throughout this chapter to &ldquo;make line&rdquo; (that is, to create space so as to add a new line to a paragraph). In a hand that is not Dickens&rsquo;s we find an instruction &ldquo;See to lines driven out,&rdquo; and a final note in Dickens hand reads &ldquo;Please string this down a little.&rdquo; Evidently, Dickens underwrote this chapter and, instead of inserting more material, wished the printers to increase the space allotted to the existing material. The discrepancy between the brevity of this chapter (5 manuscript pages) and the length of the one he had previously composed (11.5 manuscript pages) perhaps contributed to his decision to split the previous chapter into two (see headnote annotation LD.XV).</p>"

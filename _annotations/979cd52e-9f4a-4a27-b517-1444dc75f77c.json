Based upon the prior &lsquo;numbers&rsquo; and Dickens&rsquo;s general pattern of composing about a month in advance of publication, most of this &lsquo;number&rsquo; was likely composed in late April and the early parts of May (see HT.II). Dickens&rsquo;s letters that survive from this period are largely silent on the novel. In a comparatively brief letter on May 4th to W.H. Wills that mainly concerns <em>Household Words</em> business, Dickens writes under the heading &ldquo;I.&rdquo; (referring to himself), &ldquo;Growling in a general way,&rdquo; and signs the letter &ldquo;In haste&rdquo; (Letters 7.328).&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">It is during this period that Dickens begins correspondence with Elizabeth Gaskell around the publication of <em>North and South</em> in Household Words, which was to begin its serial run following the completion of <em>Hard Times</em>. His letter to her in which he confirms that &ldquo;[he] has no intention of striking&rdquo; in the novel is dated April 21st (Letters 7.320). That letter continues: &ldquo;The monstrous claims at domination made by a certain class of manufacturers, and the extent to which the way is made easy for working men to slide down into discontent under such hands, are within my scheme; but I am not going to strike.&rdquo; See the Critical Introduction for more on <em>Hard Times</em> as an industrial novel.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Weekly No. 9 appeared in <em>Household Words</em> issue no. 218, dated Saturday, May 27, 1854, with the subsequent installments appearing the following three weeks (June 3rd, 10th, and 17th).</span></p>",

The note indicates Dickens&rsquo;s interest in the nature of Frederick&rsquo;s lodging, which he will describe in detail in the novel: &ldquo;The house was very close, and had an unwholesome smell. The little staircase windows looked in at the back windows of other houses as unwholesome as itself, with poles and lines thrust out of them, on which unsightly linen hung: as if the inhabitants were angling for clothes, and had had some wretched bites not worth attending to&ldquo; (LD 89).</p>"

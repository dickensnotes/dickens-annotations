Go away, go away!&rdquo; (LD 671). Refusing to help Arthur for fear of her husband&rsquo;s retribution, she volunteers to disclose her dreams to Clennam if he is able to assert his own power over his mother and Flintwinch: &ldquo;If you ever begin to get the better of them two clever ones your own self&hellip; then do you get the better of &lsquo;em afore my face; and then do you say to me, Affery tell your dreams! Maybe, then I&rsquo;ll tell &lsquo;em!&rdquo; (671). In the final number, Dickens uses the Notes to remind himself that it will not be Arthur who calls for &ldquo;Affery&rsquo;s dreams,&rdquo; since he is unable to leave the prison: &ldquo;Affery&rsquo;s dreams. Pancks has to be deputed by Arthur to call for them&rdquo; (LD.XIX-XX.R4).</p>"

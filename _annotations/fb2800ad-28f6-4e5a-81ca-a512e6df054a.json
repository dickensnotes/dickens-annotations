A floating idea of going up above the snow-line in Switzerland, and living in some astonishing convent, hovers about me&rdquo; (Forster 2.196-7). On January 20, 1856, Dickens would again write to Forster as he was at work on No. V: &ldquo;Again I am beset by my former notions of a book whereof the whole story shall be on the top of the Great St. Bernard. As I accept and reject ideas for <em>Little Dorrit</em>, it perpetually comes back to me. Two or three years hence, perhaps you&rsquo;ll find me living with the Monks and the Dogs a whole winter&ndash;among the blinding snows that fall about that monastery. I have a serious idea that I shall do it, if I live&rdquo; (2.197). He told Lavinia Watson on October 7, 1856 that the source for the Great St. Bernard episode was a visit to the Hospice twenty years earlier (Letters 8.201; see note 3). Sucksmith offers a helpful list of the many references to his own experience from Pictures of Italy that Dickens likely drew upon for the Italy portions of Book II (xxxii, fn4). </span></p>",

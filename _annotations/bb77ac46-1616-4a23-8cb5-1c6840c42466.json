Dickens himself uses the term in <em>A Christmas Carol</em> (1843) to refer to the consequences of a person&rsquo;s actions (&ldquo;Men&rsquo;s courses will foreshadow certain ends&rdquo; [108]), and later in <em>Our Mutual Friend</em> as a synonym for foreseeing (&ldquo;Another consequence that he had never foreshadowed was&hellip;&rdquo; [380]). But in a March 1847 letter to Hablot Knight Browne discussing an illustration for <em>Dombey and Son</em>, the term became one applied to narrative craft, as it is here: &ldquo;as I wish to foreshadow, dimly&hellip;&rdquo; (Letters 5.34). He will first use the terms &ldquo;foreshadowing&rdquo; and &ldquo;shadowing forth&rdquo; in the Working Notes for <em>Bleak House</em>, where the shadow metaphor functions to indicate predetermined actions of narrative and consequence (BH_WN_02 &amp; BH_WN_05). Given the significance of the &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; motif throughout <em>Little Dorrit</em>, it is notable that Dickens adopts this term to refer to the preparatory work of narrative.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pancks&rsquo;s certainty about the safety of Merdle investments, coupled with Dickens&rsquo;s language of disease and infection (&ldquo;Mr. Pancks had taken the prevalent disease&hellip; [H]e appeared before Clennam, and the infection he threw off was all the more virulent&rdquo; [565-66]), alerts the reader to the future loss to befall both men, and thus fulfills the memorandum on the left (LD.XIV.L3).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If we are to read &ldquo;foreshadow&rdquo; as an instruction rather than a description, it is at this point in the right-hand chapter notes for this number that Dickens shifts into imperative directives.</p>",

The dreariness is set into relief by the lamplight &ldquo;suffered to introduce any show of brightness into such a dismal scene&rdquo; (31). The opening of this chapter is a timely one, with its references to the &ldquo;dire despondency&rdquo; and &ldquo;monotony&rdquo; of Sundays, when &ldquo;[e]verything was bolted and barred that could possibly furnish relief to an overworked people&rdquo; (29). As Dickens was writing this number, a series of riots took place in Hyde Park to protest Lord Robert Grosvenor&rsquo;s Sunday Trading Bill, which would restrict Sunday trading in ways that disproportionately impacted working people who were often paid on a Saturday afternoon. In a letter to Burdett-Coutts on June 27, three days after several thousand people had gathered in Hyde Park to protest the bill, Dickens makes explicit reference to Grosvenor&rsquo;s bill and laments &ldquo;the extraordinary ignorance on the part of those who make the laws&rdquo; (Letters 7.659).</p>"

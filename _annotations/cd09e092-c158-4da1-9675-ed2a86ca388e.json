Dickens&rsquo;s careful preparation for the &ldquo;Rigaud catastrophe&rdquo; begins as early as his description of the house&rsquo;s precarity in No. I, suggesting that Dickens had reason to be perturbed when James Fitzgerald Stephen accused him of basing the house&rsquo;s collapse on the collapse of three houses in Tottenham Court Road on May 9, 1857 (&ldquo;The License of Modern Novelists&rdquo;). In his defense, Dickens wrote an article in <em>Household Words </em>in which he insisted that &ldquo;the catastrophe is carefully prepared for from the very first presentation of the old house in the story&hellip; the rotten and crazy state of the house is laboriously kept before the reader, whenever the house is shown\" (&ldquo;Curious Misprint&rdquo; 97). Indeed, when Dickens refers to the impending &ldquo;Catastrophe&rdquo; in the Notes for No. XVII, he again references their long preparation (see LD.XVII.R3). For more on Dickens&rsquo;s response to Stephen, see LD.XIX-XX.R10 and Critical Introduction.</p>"

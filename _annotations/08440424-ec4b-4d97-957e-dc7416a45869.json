The manuscript and notes for No. IV are written in a combination of black and blue ink, which is particularly helpful in understanding the temporal aspects of the installment&rsquo;s composition. There are several visible layers of each color of ink.&nbsp;</span><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-5a88cbc3-7fff-1a86-2779-bbbbb20bb32b\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">It appears that the title and chapter headings were written first, at the same time as the notes for chapter 12 about Aunt Betsey and the donkey cart. The ink here appears to match the note, \"what I know so well,&rdquo; on the left-hand side. The other notes in black (the title and notes for chapter 10, and the notes for chapter 11) are bolder and darker, and so were probably written later. Two different layers of blue ink contrast with one another&mdash;one comprising the title of chapter 12 and the final notes for chapter 10; and the second layer comprising the title of chapter 11 and potentially the emendation to the title of chapter 12.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">That the notes for chapter twelve appear to be written at the same time as the headings and the left-side memoranda suggests that Dickens had a clear sense of the direction of the narrative, and of the event that would keep serial readers in anticipation for the subsequent September installment: David's departure from London.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">It's likely, then, that Dickens began the Working Note for No. IV while writing No. III (or shortly after its completion), proactively documenting what he intended to be the number's central subjects: David's situation in London (\"what I know so well&rdquo;) and his decision to leave it. Either or both of these must have been the \"move\" Dickens had in mind while writing to Forster during composition of No. III: \"I feel, thank God, quite confident in the story. I have a move in it ready for this month; another for the next; and another for the next.\" (Letters 5.551)&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">It appears that it was not unusual for Dickens to set up one or even several Working Notes well in advance of the composition of the corresponding number, a hypothesis corroborated by several later notes which are entirely in blue ink, other than the heading(s), which are black (see DC_WN_12, DC_WN_13, and DC_WN_18).</span></p>"

I do NOT forget, though I do not read it as he did. I read in it, that I was appointed to do these things&rdquo; (LD 756). Flintwinch will add precision to Mr. Clennam&rsquo;s meaning: &ldquo;You know very well that the Do Not Forget, at the time when his father sent that watch to you, could only mean, the rest of the story being then all dead and over, Do Not Forget the suppression. Make restitution!&rdquo; (760).</p>"

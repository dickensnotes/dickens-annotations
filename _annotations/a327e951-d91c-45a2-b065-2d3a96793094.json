Described as &ldquo;delicate and very inexperienced indeed&rdquo; (LD 49), she enters the narrative for half a chapter to deliver Little Dorrit inside the prison, and she is not even granted a first name before she is dispatched out of the novel when Little Dorrit is eight years old. We&rsquo;re told that she had &ldquo;long been languishing away&rdquo; and that she &ldquo;went on a visit to a poor friend and old nurse in the country, and died there&rdquo; (54).</p>"

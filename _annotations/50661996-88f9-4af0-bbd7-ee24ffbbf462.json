The phrasing of this likely prospective note does not mirror language used in the chapter; its unusual imperatives (&ldquo;anatomise,&rdquo; &ldquo;see&rdquo;) suggest dissection of a living being. Interestingly, the only use of the word &ldquo;anatomise&rdquo; in the novel is applied to Gowan himself. Miss Wade, in her &ldquo;History of a Self-Tormentor&rdquo; narrative, praises Mr Gowan as one &ldquo;who knew&hellip; how to anatomise the wretched people around us&rdquo; (LD 650).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stone renders the word &ldquo;Anatomize&rdquo; in his transcriptions. While Dickens&rsquo;s &ldquo;s&rdquo; is hard to read here, the one use of the word in the novel (in chapter 21) was rendered with an &ldquo;s&rdquo; by the printers (though it is similarly hard to make out in the manuscript), suggesting that the intention here was an &ldquo;s&rdquo; rather than a &ldquo;z.&rdquo;</p>"

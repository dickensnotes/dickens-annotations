He rejected Phiz&rsquo;s first attempt at illustrating the dinner in a letter written on February 10, 1857: &ldquo;In the dinner scene, it is highly important that Mr. Dorrit should not be too comic. He is too comic now. He is described in the text as &lsquo;shedding tears&rsquo;, and what he imperatively wants, is an expression doing less violence in the reader&rsquo;s mind to what is going to happen to him, and much more in accordance with that serious end which is so close before him&rdquo; (Letters 8.280).</p>"

Revisiting his childhood home, &ldquo;years seemed to fall away from [Arthur] like the imaginings of a dream, and all the old dark horrors of his usual preparation for the sleep of an innocent child to overshadow him&rdquo; (36). See Critical Introduction for more on how Dickens recalled his own childhood as he worked on this novel.</p>"

In the proof, he removed the quotation marks around &ldquo;it never does,&rdquo; but he did not return to erase them from either Note or manuscript. The chapter title in this note is in a notably lighter, thinner ink than that of the chapter notes, indicating that title and content notes are separate temporal layers.</p>"

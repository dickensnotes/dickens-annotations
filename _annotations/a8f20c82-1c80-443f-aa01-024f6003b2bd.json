In the manuscript, the first part of the sentence initially reads &ldquo;If he had only known a little less,&rdquo; but Dickens changes &ldquo;known&rdquo; to &ldquo;learnt&rdquo; in the corrected proofs. This minor alteration reinforces the idea of learning as indoctrination that is developed in this paragraph introducing M&rsquo;Choakumchild and his own education: &ldquo;He had some one hundred and forty other schoolmasters, had been lately turned at the same time, in the same factory, on the same principles, like so many pianoforte legs&rdquo; (HT 52-53). On the 25th of January&ndash;in the period when had begun writing the new novel in earnest&ndash;Dickens was preoccupied with the matter of teacher training and wrote to W.H. Wills with a request: &ldquo;I want (for the story I am trying to hammer out) the Education Board&rsquo;s series of questions for the examination of teachers in schools. Will you get it&rdquo; (Letters 7.258).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

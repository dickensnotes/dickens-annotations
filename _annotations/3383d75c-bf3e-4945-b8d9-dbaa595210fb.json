Try this uncertainty and this not-putting of them together, as a new means of interest. Indicate and carry through this intension.&rdquo; Dickens &ldquo;indicated&rdquo; this intention in Book I, chapter 2, using the language of travellers &ldquo;coming and going so strangely, to meet and to act and react on one another&rdquo; (LD 26), and &ldquo;carried it through&rdquo; in chapter 15, with a reference to the &ldquo;vast multitude of travellers&hellip; coming and going so strangely, to meet and to act and react one one another&rdquo; (173). It is in this chapter that the novel makes that traveling literal. This chapter parallels chapter 2 of the first book in its intentional delayed revelation of characters&rsquo; identities, as indicated in this note, as if making into a narrative strategy the idea that the connection between travelers will not be &ldquo;shewn to the reader.&rdquo; While the characters in this chapter are recognizable based on their traits, their names are not revealed until they are read from the &ldquo;Travellers&rsquo; Book&rdquo; at the chapter&rsquo;s close by Blandois.</p>"

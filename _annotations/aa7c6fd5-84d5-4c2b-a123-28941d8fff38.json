In that chapter, Skimpole suggests that they \"had better turn [Jo] out\" rather than offering him shelter (BH 493). Although his suggestion is rebuffed, Jo has disappeared the next morning without explanation: \"At what time of the night he had gone, or how, or why, it seemed hopeless ever to divine. The door remaining as it had been left, and the lantern standing in the window, it could only be supposed that he had got out by a trap in the floor which communicated with an empty cart-house below. But he had shut it down again, if that were so; and it looked as if it had not been raised. Nothing of any kind was missing. On this fact being clearly ascertained, we all yielded to the painful belief that delirium had come upon him in the night, and that, allured by some imaginary object, or pursued by some imaginary horror, he had strayed away in that worse than helpless state;&ndash;all of us, that is to say, but Mr Skimploe, who repeatedly suggested, in his usual easy light style, that it had occurred to our young friend that he was not a safe inmate, having a bad kind of fever upon him; and that he had, with great natural politeness, taken himself off\" (BH 497-8).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

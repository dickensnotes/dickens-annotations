The other, kneeling on the floor, drooped over it; the arms easily and peacefully resting on the coverlet; the face bowed down, so that the lips touched the hand over which with its last breath it had bent. The two brothers were before their Father; far beyond the twilight judgment of this world; high above its mists and obscurities&rdquo; (LD 632).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This note is written in small script, as is much of the content in the second half of this chapter note, in order to fit it into the available space.</p>"

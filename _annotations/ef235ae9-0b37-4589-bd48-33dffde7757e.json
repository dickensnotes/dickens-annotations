The right-hand notes for each chapter contain a similar reference to the preparatory foreshadowing of Merdle&rsquo;s downfall. While Dickens does not reserve the language of &ldquo;pave the way&rdquo; for Merdle (the same phrase appears in numbers V and VII for other purposes, see LD.V.L6 and LD.VII.R4), he evidently uses this instruction to emphasize the importance of preparatory narrative work; the same phrase appears on the right in the chapter notes for both chapters 5 and 6: &ldquo;Pave the Merdle way&rdquo; (LD.XII.R4) and &ldquo;Pave on the Merdle way&rdquo; (LD.XII.R12). Chapter 7 must &ldquo;Work distantly up to Mr Merdle&rdquo; (LD.XII.R18). The &ldquo;distant&rdquo; treatment here is significant, since Mr. Merdle does not appear in the number. Despite his absence, as Herring argues, &ldquo;virtually the entire plot movement of the novel&rdquo; at this point is tied up in &ldquo;the diagnosis of Mr. Merdle&rsquo;s complaint&rdquo; in No. XVII, since his downfall will precipitate that of Mr. Dorrit and of Clennam (Herring 45).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />Dickens had already started this preparatory work, using the same language in No. X: &ldquo;Pave the way for a change in Mr Merdle&rsquo;s manner&rdquo; (LD.X.R4). Indeed, preparation for Merdle&rsquo;s fate has been ongoing since No. VI, when Dickens specifies his fate in the Notes: &ldquo;Fraud &amp; Forgery bye and bye&rdquo; (LD.VI.R17).</p>"

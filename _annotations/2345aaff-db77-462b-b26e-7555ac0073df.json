Dickens&rsquo;s original intention to give Minnie Meagles the nickname &ldquo;Baby&rdquo; remained in the manuscript. He would correct this to &ldquo;Pet&rdquo; in the proofs throughout this chapter. Only one &ldquo;Baby&rdquo; remains in the novel: towards the end of the chapter Tattycoram exclaims &ldquo;it&rsquo;s she that&rsquo;s always petted and called Baby! I detest the name. I hate her&rdquo; (LD 25). Whether this was an oversight or an intentional remainder of the original name is unclear.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Meagles was one of the names Dickens listed in his Memoranda book and checked off as used in this novel (3v).&nbsp;</p>"

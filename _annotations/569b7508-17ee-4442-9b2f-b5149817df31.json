In this instance, Arthur dwells on what he suspects to be his mother&rsquo;s potential involvement in Mr. Dorrit&rsquo;s imprisonment: &ldquo;A swift thought shot into his mind. In that long imprisonment here, and in her own long confinement to her room, did his mother find a balance to be struck? I admit that I was accessory to that man&rsquo;s captivity. I have suffered for it in kind. He has decayed in his prison; I in mine. I have paid the penalty&rdquo; (LD 86). The parallelism Dickens explores here mirrors the parallelism of his titling for chapters 6 and 7 (labeled here as 5 and 6).</p>"

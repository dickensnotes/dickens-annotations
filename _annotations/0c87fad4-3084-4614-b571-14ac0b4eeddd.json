While it was established practice and agreement that his novels would be published in volume form upon the completion of their serial run, this was not included in Dickens&rsquo;s publication agreement with Bradbury &amp; Evans for <em>Hard Times</em>: &ldquo;That the copyright of the story for separate publication apart from Household Words in any form he may think fit to belong solely and absolutely to Mr. Charles Dickens&rdquo; (Letters 7.911). Dickens no doubt had his eye on the profits to be made by eventually publishing in volume form from the very outset, and his decision at this time to later adopt these divisions perhaps enabled him to better manage the progress of the story. The eventual book divisions map directly onto the &lsquo;numbers&rsquo; Dickens used for the Working Notes: Book 1 comprises Numbers I and II (chapters 1-16); Book 2 comprises Numbers III &amp; IV (chapters 17-28); and Book 3 comprises the final &ldquo;double&rdquo; Number (chapters 29-37).</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /><br /></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">On the 13th of July, Dickens wrote to Thomas Carlyle as he was completing the composition of the novel and was looking ahead to its republication to ask if he could dedicate the novel to him: &ldquo;I am going, next month, to publish in One Volume a story now coming out in Household Words, called Hard Times. I have constructed it patiently, with a view to its publication altogether in a compact cheap form. It contains what I do devoutly hope will shake some people in a terrible mistake of these days, when so presented. I know it contains nothing in which you do not think with me, for no man knows your books better than I. I want to put in the first page of it, that it is inscribed to Thomas Carlyle. May I?&rdquo; (Letters 7.367).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Ear-rings in his brown ears, white teeth lighting up his grotesque brown face, intensely black hair clustering about his brown throat, a ragged red shirt open at his brown breast&rdquo; (LD 6). Dickens evidently decided to make Cavalletto a Neopolitan: He mentions Naples twice in his introduction (&ldquo;Judge if I come back from Naples as I went!&rdquo;), though he does mention Genoa in his list of places through which he has traveled up the Italian coast before imprisonment (&ldquo;Civita Vecchnia, Leghorn, Porto Fino, Genoa, Cornice, Off Nice (which is in there), Marseilles, you and me&rdquo; [6]), and the &ldquo;little man&rdquo; (11) uses a &ldquo;Genoese emphasis&rdquo; on the word &ldquo;Altro&rdquo; (9). Dickens added &ldquo;Genoese&rdquo; in that instance in a later proof, since it does not appear in the manuscript or in the extant early proofs.&nbsp;<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ac28fac2-7fff-c374-8c8a-8d059732564e\"></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Alistair Duckworth stresses the &ldquo;frankness of the mediation&rdquo; between notes such as this one and their manifestation in the novel: &ldquo;&lsquo;Picture of an Italian&rsquo; summons up a cultural code, a stereotype, which the text will proceed to operate&rdquo; (123), he writes. &ldquo;It is not a question of these characterizations being laid bare in the number plans and then concealed or sophisticated in the text; the text, too, frankly confesses the stereotype&rdquo; (124).</p>"

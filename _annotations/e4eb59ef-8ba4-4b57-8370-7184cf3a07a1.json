The box around Maggy&rsquo;s name in this Note indicates her role as an onlooker to the scene, but also her unconscious awareness of Little Dorrit&rsquo;s emotional state. She both knows and does not know. Maggy will also appear in the companion scene &ldquo;in that room, long afterwards&rdquo;; Dickens may even have returned to his notes for this reminder of her presence (LD.XVIII.L1).&nbsp;</p>"

Here, as he works his way through to the end of Book I, Dickens includes decisive notes on the left summarizing the two principal events of the number: marriage and fortune, both endings and new beginnings appropriate to the end of one book and setup for the next. These left-hand notes also lay the ground for Clennam&rsquo;s continued relationship with Little Dorrit via his commitment to improve relations between Mr. Meagles back in England, and Pet&rsquo;s new husband Gowan, who will encounter the Dorrits on their continental travels.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Multiple layers are evident on both sides of the page, indicating Dickens&rsquo;s heavy use of this Note to help him manage elements to include in this final number. The chapter notes on the right, with their combination of brevity, future-oriented phrases, and summaries of the main focus of each chapter, appear to be largely prospective.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Dickens wrote the bulk of No. X in July 1856. On July 8, he told William Macready that the &ldquo;beginning of No. X&ndash;the first line&ndash;now lies upon my desk&rdquo; (Letters 8.156). On July 13 he reported to Wilkie Collins that he was &ldquo;hard at it with Little Dorrit, and am now doing No. X&rdquo; (8.162). He was likely still working on the number on August 8 when he wrote to Macready that he could not schedule a reading because it would &ldquo;shake Little Dorrit out of my head&rdquo; (8.171).</p>"

Instead, she describes her discovery of a letter &ldquo;lying with this watch in his secret drawer&rdquo; as fated: &ldquo;it had been appointed to me to make the discovery&rdquo; (LD 753).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is at this point that the mems slip into Mrs. Clennam&rsquo;s voice. The extent to which Dickens focalizes these notes through Mrs. Clennam suggests his recognition that the story must be told, at least in part, in her own words, as he will recognize in his chapter note: &ldquo;Tell the whole story, working it out as much as possible through Mrs Clennam herself, so as to present her character very strongly&rdquo; (LD.XIX-XX.R3).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The remainder of this long note, in the voice of Mrs. Clennam, corresponds to the following passages in chapter 30 (LD 755):</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;&lsquo;You have a child; I have none. You love that child. Give him to me. He shall believe himself to be my son, and he shall be believed by every one to be my son. To save you from exposure, his father shall swear never to see or communicate with you more; equally to save him from being stripped by his uncle, and to save your child from being a beggar, you shall swear never to see or communicate with either of them more. That done, and your present means, derived from my husband, renounced, I charge myself with your support&rsquo;... She was then free to bear her load of guilt in secret, and to break her heart in secret; and through such present misery (light enough for her, I think!) to purchase her redemption from endless misery, if she could.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I devoted myself to reclaim the otherwise predestined and lost boy; to give him the reputation of an honest origin; to bring him up in fear and trembling, and in a life of practical contrition for the sins that were heavy on his head before his entrance into this condemned world.&rdquo;</p>"

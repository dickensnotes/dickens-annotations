This is the first encounter between Pancks and Little Dorrit; we see her discomfort around the fact that &ldquo;he began to pervade her daily life&rdquo; (LD 281-22), but also an indication that the shadow cast by Pancks might be a kind one: &ldquo;Her eyes met his as she looked up wonderingly into his face, and she thought that although his were sharp eyes, he was a brighter and gentler-looking man than she had supposed at dinner&rdquo; (280).</p>"

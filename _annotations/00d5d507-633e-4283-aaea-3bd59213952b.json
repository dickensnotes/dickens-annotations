Wills that he was &ldquo;just now trying to settle to No. 3 of the new book&ndash;a hideous state of mind in which I walk down stairs once in every five minutes, look out of the window once in every two, and do nothing else&rdquo; (Letters 7.699). He was still early in the process on September 16, when he wrote to Forster: &ldquo;I am just now getting to work on number three: sometimes enthusiastic, more often dull enough&rdquo; (Letters 7.701).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was as he was writing this number that Dickens began to settle on a clearer vision for the novel and resolve some of the restlessness he had experienced when beginning the book. This is the last number for which Dickens corrected <em>Nobody&rsquo;s Fault</em> to <em>Little Dorrit</em> in both the Notes and the manuscript. It is also the last number for which the surviving corrected proofs have no running title. It was thus as he was writing this number that Dickens decided to commit to Little Dorrit&rsquo;s centrality in the novel: &ldquo;I can make Dorrit very strong in the story, I hope,&rdquo; he wrote to Forster on September 16 (Forster 2.182). The inaction and lack of responsibility implied by the original title are worked into the number&rsquo;s content via the Circumlocution Office (see Critical Introduction). Dickens wrote proudly to his neighbor Frank Stone in January, shortly before the number&rsquo;s publication, that &ldquo;[t]here is a dash in No. 3 at the great system of abuse under which we live, that will flutter the Doves in the House of Commons Lobby, I flatter myself!&rdquo; (Letters 8.36).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The number brings the Clennam and Dorrit stories together and further connects the fates of many of the characters he had introduced in No. I (Clennam and Mr. Meagles; Rigaud and Cavaletto). It is also at this stage in his writing that Dickens considered the future possibility of the Dorrits&rsquo; discovered wealth; he wrote to Forster: &ldquo;I am not quite resolved, but I have a great idea of overwhelming that family with wealth. Their condition would be very curious&rdquo; (Letters 7.701). Dickens wrote to his publishers, Bradbury &amp; Evans, on October 29, not long after he finished the number, to ask them to leave blank pages for the titles of the two books, Poverty and Wealth (Letters 7.729).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The content of the chapter notes on the right-hand side are written in a significantly lighter ink than that used to write the manuscript for this number, which is darker, closer in color to the chapter titles and the left-hand notes. Many of the chapter notes seem to be in a consistent ink and hand, the ink color similar to that used for the corrected novel title at the top of the page, which may suggest that this was all one temporal layer, perhaps written after the completion of the manuscript as retrospective memoranda. The two uncertainties in these chapter notes (the questions &ldquo;Bangham?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Break of Day?&rdquo;) both correspond to changes Dickens made to the manuscript as small edits (see LD.III.R6 and LD.III.R15). It seems quite possible, then, that Dickens used the Working Note to consider aspects of an already- or partially-drafted number and to raise questions about items about which he was still unsure.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />In a novel that has been so concerned so far with interior spaces, with being shut in and imprisoned, it is notable that this number includes a series of scenes <em>outside</em>. In chapter 9 we see Clennam and Little Dorrit&rsquo;s conversation on the Iron Bridge, where they are subject to the strong wind and &ldquo;wet squalls&rdquo; (LD 79), and where Clennam has to use his body to shelter her from the elements (&ldquo;putting himself between her and the sharp wind and rain, sheltered her as well as he could&rdquo; [81]), after which they walk &ldquo;through the miserable muddy streets&rdquo; where they are &ldquo;jostled by the crowds of dirty hucksters usual to a poor neighbourhood&rdquo; (82), in a way that prefigures their walk &ldquo;down into the roaring streets&rdquo; at the end of the novel (802). We also see Clennam and Doyce shut out of the Circumlocution office and Rigaud walking through the &ldquo;flat expanse of country about Chalons,&rdquo; bitterly regarding a town that refuses to welcome him (104).</p>",

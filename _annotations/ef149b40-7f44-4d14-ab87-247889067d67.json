While the chapter describes Gowan as &ldquo;idle&rdquo; and &ldquo;difficult to settle&rdquo; (LD 201), the phrase Dickens uses in this Note does not appear directly in the chapter. In fact, there is no indication that Gowan was placed in a government position. It is not until No. VIII (chapter 26) that we get more detail about Gowan&rsquo;s position, when Mrs. Gowan&rsquo;s &ldquo;melancholy&rdquo; is described as being &ldquo;occasioned by her son&rsquo;s being reduced to court the swinish public as a follower of the low Arts, instead of asserting his birthright and putting a ring through its nose as an acknowledged Barnacle&rdquo; (LD 305).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In Gowan, Dickens drew directly from his&nbsp;<em>Memoranda</em>&nbsp;book, marking as &ldquo;Done in Dorrit&rdquo; a note that contains the phrases: &ldquo;I affect to be always book-keeping &lt;and&gt; in every man&rsquo;s case and posting up a little account of good and evil with every one. Thus the greatest rascal becomes &lsquo;the dearest old fellow,&rsquo; and there is much less difference than you would be inclined to suppose between an honest man and a Scoundrel&rdquo; (9). These phrases become, in this chapter, &ldquo;&lsquo;I claim to be always book-keeping, with a peculiar nicety, in every man&rsquo;s case, and posting up a careful little account of Good and Evil with him. I do this so conscientiously, that I am happy to tell you I find the most worthless of men to be the dearest old fellow too: and am in a condition to make the gratifying report, that there is much less difference than you are inclined to suppose between an honest man and a scoundrel&rdquo; (LD 200).</p>\n<p><br />See more on Dickens&rsquo;s spelling of Gowan as Gowran in subsequent left-hand memoranda in&nbsp;LD.VII&nbsp;headnote and&nbsp;LD.VII.L5.</p>",

In the Note for No. V, he writes: &ldquo;First suggestion of her being in love with Clennam&rdquo; (LD.V.R19). This &ldquo;dawn&rdquo; of love is activated in this number via another reference to the shadow: Clennam views &ldquo;a tremor on her lip, and a passing shadow of great agitation on her face,&rdquo; which he reads as both a reference to her feelings about her father and something he connects with &ldquo;a new fancy&rdquo; about her (LD 254). Notably, this &ldquo;new fancy&rdquo; gestures towards Arthur&rsquo;s own feelings about hopeless love, as well as Little Dorrit&rsquo;s: &ldquo;The Little Dorrit, trembling on his arm, was less in unison than ever with Mrs. Chivalry&rsquo;s theory, and yet was not irreconcilable with a new fancy which sprung up within him, that there might be some one else, in the hopeless&ndash;newer fancy still&ndash;in the hopeless unattainable distance&rdquo; (254).&nbsp;</p>"

Forster explains that Dickens had &ldquo;sallied out for one of his night walks, full of thoughts of his story, one wintry rainy evening,&rdquo; when he came across seven girls, like &ldquo;seven heaps of rags,&rdquo; outside the full Whitechapel Workhouse, drawing a crowd because of their &ldquo;wretchedness&rdquo; (Forster 2.131).</p>"

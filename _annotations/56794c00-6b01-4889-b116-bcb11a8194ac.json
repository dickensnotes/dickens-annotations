The Inns of Chancery date from the middle of the 14th century and eventually came to be used as offices and accommodations for solicitors. By the nineteenth century, the single unified association of solicitors diminished the function of the Inns. Symonds Inn dated from the 17th century and was located on the east side of Chancery Lane, south of High Holborn; it was demolished in 1873. While working as a lawyer's clerk in the late 1820s, Dickens appears to have worked in legal chambers located in Symond's Inn (among others) (see Parker). Cursitor Street is located to the southeast and where the Snagsbys live. Both Carey Street (west of Chancery Lane) and Dyer's Buildings (further east of Chancery Lane) are also nearby.&nbsp; </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

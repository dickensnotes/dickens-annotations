By having Fanny mention her sister, the installment is able to &ldquo;take up Amy&rdquo; without devoting sustained narrative attention to her grief, and to suggest her impending arrival in London. Fanny indicates Amy&rsquo;s suffering after the death of their father (&ldquo;my poor little pet was devotedly attached to poor papa, and no doubt will have lamented his loss exceedingly&rdquo;) and suggests that she will &ldquo;need to be roused from a low tendency which I know very well to be at the bottom of her heart&rdquo; (LD 677).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although it is difficult to determine with certainty, the ink for this entry and those below appears to be darker than that used in the notes above, suggesting a new temporal layer, one fairly consistent with the chapter notes for the following chapter.</p>"

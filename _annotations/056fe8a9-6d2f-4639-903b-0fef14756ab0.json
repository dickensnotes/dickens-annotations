Esther eventually discovers her mother in the burial ground, but the mention of her \"long dank hair\" in that scene conjures the image of a drowned body evoked at the outset of the number: \"I was far from sure that I was not in a dream. We rattled with great rapidity through such a labyrinth of streets that I soon lost all idea where we were, except that we had crossed and re-crossed the river, and still seemed to be traversing a low-lying, waterside, dense neighbourhood of narrow thoroughfares chequered by docks and basins, high piles of warehouses, swing-bridges, and masts of ships. At length we stopped at the corner of a little slimy turning, which the wind from the river, rushing up it, did not purify; and I saw my companion, by the light of his lantern, in conference with several men who looked like a mixture of police and sailors. Against the mouldering wall by which they stood, there was a bill, on which I could discern the words, &lsquo;Found Drowned&rsquo;; and this and an inscription about drags possessed me with the awful suspicion shadowed forth in our visit to that place\" (BH 868-9).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Dickens visited Paris in early 1855, so it is possible that it was here that he encountered a clarinet-player he would later use as inspiration for Frederick Dorrit, the &ldquo;ruined uncle in the family group&rdquo; (LD 72). Dickens would refer to the Ambigu Theatre in a later letter to Mark Lemon (7 January 1856, Letters 8.11), but there is no mention in his letters of a clarinet player or a notable earlier mention of the Ambigu.</p>"

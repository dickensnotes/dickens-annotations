Tom, of course, &ldquo;shews&rdquo; Harthouse the nature of Louisa&rsquo;s marriage and how it came about, and the close of the chapter hints at the consequences: &ldquo;The whelp went home, and went to bed. If he had had any sense of what he had done that night, and had been less of a whelp and more of a brother, he might have turned short on the road, might have gone down to the ill-smelling river that was dyed black, might have gone to bed in it for good and all, and have curtained his head for ever with its filthy waters&rdquo; (HT 169). </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

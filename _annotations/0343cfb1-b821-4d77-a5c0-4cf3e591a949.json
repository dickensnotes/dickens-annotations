In confronting John Chivery, Mr. Dorrit must confront his past, and his experience of the &ldquo;insult&rdquo; of the visit (LD 610), along with his shame at his own reaction, allows Dickens to introduce the first specific symptoms of his decline: &ldquo;Mr. Dorrit was ashamed. He went back to the window, and leaned his forehead against the glass for some time. When he turned, he had his handkerchief in his hand, and he had been wiping his eyes with it, and he looked tired and ill&rdquo; (613).&nbsp;</p>"

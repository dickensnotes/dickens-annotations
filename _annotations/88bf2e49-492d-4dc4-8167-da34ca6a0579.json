Indeed, the chapter ends with a hint of discord between Pancks and the Patriarch, when the latter accuses Pancks of &ldquo;a very bad day&rsquo;s work&rdquo; (LD 273). This indication of relations sets up Pancks&rsquo;s future public humiliation of Casby in the final double number (LD.XIX-XX.R12).</p>"

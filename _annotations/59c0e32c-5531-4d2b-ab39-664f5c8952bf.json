It is rare for Dickens to begin a memorandum with a conjunction. This one implies a continuation of ideas between this and the note above, though the notes are separated by one of Dickens&rsquo;s trademark non-textual markings indicating a separate item, and the ink colors appear to indicate a new temporal layer. The family will not move to Rome until the very end of the number, after Fanny has already announced to Amy that &ldquo;Mrs. General has designs on Pa!&rdquo; (LD 491).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The final memorandum on the page (&ldquo;Lead, very carefully, on&rdquo;) does not appear to be clearly connected with a specific referent, separated from the note above as it is by a line break and by an erased &ldquo;also,&rdquo; as if Dickens changed his mind about adding a new item and instead emphasized the need for caution in composing this number as a whole. What precisely should be led on with care? Combined with the number of instructions throughout this Note, this phrase indicates Dickens&rsquo;s sense that this number must establish or continue a number of ongoing narrative threads that will come to fruition in future numbers, including the Merdle fraud, Mr. Dorrit&rsquo;s downfall, Fanny&rsquo;s marriage, and Rigaud/Blandois&rsquo;s deceit.</p>"

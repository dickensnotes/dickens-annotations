The last long sentence, which was heavily revised in the manuscript, reads, in part: &ldquo;He, the uncouth object of such wide-spread adulation&hellip; was simply the greatest Forger and the greatest Thief that ever cheated the gallows.&rdquo; Dickens erases &ldquo;Fraud&rdquo; in the Note, only to rewrite it, but the term does not appear in this final chapter. Instead, Dickens emphasizes theft in the pairing of &ldquo;Forgery and Robbery.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Dickens had prepared for this revelation as early as No. VI, the notes to which link Merdle&rsquo;s &ldquo;complaint&rdquo; with forgery and fraud: &ldquo;Mr Merdle&rsquo;s mysterious complaint (, to wit: [Forgery] Fraud &amp; Forgery bye and bye&rdquo; (LD.VI.R17). Dickens emphasizes the discovery of the complaint when Physician makes his initial call upon Bar after discovering the body: &ldquo;You asked me once what Merdle&rsquo;s complaint was,&rdquo; Physician says. &ldquo;I have found it out&rdquo; (LD 687-688).&nbsp;</p>"

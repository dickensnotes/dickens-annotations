Still undecided about Dora, but MUST decide to-day\" (Letters 6.94). Presumably, Dickens was uncertain whether to have David and Dora marry at the end of the installment he was about to begin, or to defer the marriage, or even break the engagement. Forster has commented that Dickens&rsquo;s&nbsp; &ldquo;principal hesitation&rdquo; in writing the novel &ldquo;occurred in connection with the child-wife, Dora, who had become a great favourite as he went on\" (2.90).</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The decision Dickens was to make regarding David and Dora&rsquo;s marriage was important, since it would almost certainly determine Dora&rsquo;s fate. Since Agnes was to be the novel&rsquo;s &ldquo;real heroine&rdquo; (DC_WN_05), and since Dickens had hinted at David&rsquo;s growing attachment to Agnes all through the early months of 1850, it would be very unusual to have them marry by the novel&rsquo;s close. The decision to marry Dora and David at the end of No. XIV, then, was probably made at the same time as the decision to have Dora die at the conclusion of No. XVII.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Whatever the exact nature of Dickens's hesitation, and the alternatives he entertained, he had apparently settled his doubts before beginning No. XIV, which focuses on David and Dora's romance and builds confidently toward their wedding. Even the installment's major digression, which deals with the Strongs' marriage, related back to David and Dora&mdash;it prepares for the confrontation between Dr. Strong and Annie in No. XV that will be so importantly \"brought to bear on David\" and his \"undisciplined heart\" (DC_WN_15; see <em>DC.XV.R2</em>). </span></p>",

The question &ldquo;Could you lend me a penknife?&rdquo; is also included verbatim; he refuses the mother-of-pearl one offered in favor of &ldquo;one with a darker handle&rdquo;: &ldquo;I should prefer tortoise-shell&rdquo; (680). &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll undertake not to ink it&rdquo; Mr. Merdle insists when he takes the pen-knife. Pen-knives were used to re-cut quill pens, and thus were often &ldquo;inked&rdquo;; of course, Merdle will &ldquo;ink&rdquo; the knife with his blood (687).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This note pertains to the scene depicted in one of Browne&rsquo;s illustrations for the number: &ldquo;Mr. Merdle a borrower&rdquo;. Dickens wrote to Browne approving these illustrations, adding &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t distinctly make out the detail but I take Sparkler to be getting the tortoise-shell knife from the box.&ndash;Am I right?&rdquo; (Letters 8.297).</p>"

This is the chapter in which Pancks pulls together those who will help him reveal Mr. Dorrit&rsquo;s fortune. His decision to &ldquo;work&rdquo; this character &ldquo;in&rdquo; to Pancks&rsquo;s scheme allows Pancks to focus his scheme on doing good for Little Dorrit in particular, rather than for her father alone.&nbsp;</p>"

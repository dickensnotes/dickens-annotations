Rigaud&rsquo;s characteristic facial expression, significant enough to be mentioned in the notes, appears three times in the first chapter, first elaborated in reverse of the note, as follows: &ldquo;When Monsieur Rigaud laughed, a change took place in his face, that was more remarkable than prepossessing. His moustache went up under his nose, and his nose came down over his moustache, in a very sinister and cruel manner&rdquo; (7). &hellip; &ldquo;his moustache went up, and his nose came down&rdquo; (8). It will become a leitmotif for the character throughout the novel, helping the reader to identify him even as his name changes.</p>"

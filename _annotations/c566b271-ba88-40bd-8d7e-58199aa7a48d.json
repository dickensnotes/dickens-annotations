See also BH.XIX-XX.L5 and HT.II.L4). Portraits may have been on his mind at this time, since Dickens was sitting for his self-described &ldquo;nightmare portrait&rdquo; by Ary Scheffer (Letters 8.8; see illustration in Critical Introduction). Unlike his own portrait, which Dickens described as &ldquo;not look[ing] to me at all like&hellip; the original&rdquo; (8.9), the portrait of Minnie Gowan and her twin bears a striking resemblance to Pet: &ldquo;both are still so like you,&rdquo; exclaims Clennam (LD 189). </span></p>"

The second, beginning &ldquo;I ask, what was the penitence,&rdquo; includes Mrs. Clennam&rsquo;s account of her visit to Arthur&rsquo;s mother demanding she relinquish her child (755). The third, beginning &ldquo;That Frederick Dorrit was the beginning of it all,&rdquo; describes how Mr. Clennam met Arthur&rsquo;s mother (757). These three passages deal with specific details of the Clennam story and were presumably difficult for Dickens to write; he likely used these slips to replace passages with heavy deletions and revisions that he was no longer able to edit legibly. An additional section, comprising the conversation between Mr. Flintwinch and Cavalletto (from &ldquo;At whom&hellip; to consequentementally&rdquo; [744]) is added on the verso of the third manuscript page.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are also significant deletions to parts of this long chapter in the proofs, the most significant of which include interactions between Rigaud and Flintwinch. For more on Dickens&rsquo;s erasures and manuscript revisions for this chapter, see Brattin.&nbsp;</p>"

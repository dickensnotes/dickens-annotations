It seems that Dickens first wrote the majority of the notes and queries down to \"Mems for the Progress,\" before adding, some time later, the yes/no responses to the queries, the note about the \"Dictionary,\" and three memoranda pertaining to the Micawbers (\"The Medway Coal Trade\"; \"'Turn his attention to coals\"; and \"Mr Micawber's letter\"). The five &ldquo;mems&rdquo; relating to the retrospect chapter might potentially have been written at a different time to the responses above&mdash;either before or after. The ink appears slightly darker, and the nib slightly thicker.&nbsp;</span><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-eb00e058-7fff-2c1f-6e30-199ecd316ea7\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The first pass of ink on the left side of the Note appears to have been written at the same time as the headings and the notes for chapter 16 on the right side, and the second (and/or third) pass(es) at the same time as the notes for chapters 17 and 18. The responses above \"mems for the progress\" resemble the notes for chapter 17 more closely, while the five \"mems for the progress\" appear more similar to those made for chapter 18.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">If the yes/no responses were made alongside the notes for chapter 17, as late as the proofing stage (see <em>DC.VI.R2</em>), then they were made after the composition of the number. In this case, then, it appears that the question/answer mode was used not to facilitate a proactive process of selection and rejection but rather a retroactive record of what Dickens had, in the process of composition, decided &ldquo;worked.&rdquo; The early memoranda, then, provided the possibilities for the number, but the actual content of the installment was worked out in the manuscript during composition. The retroactive responses and &ldquo;mems&rdquo; gave the salient points of the monthly number at a glance, allowing Dickens to incorporate them into the narrative as it progressed. The themes of the \"Dictionary\" and the \"Coal Trade,\" for example, are both revisited several months later:&nbsp; Doctor Strong employs David to help with the Dictionary in No. XII; and Mrs. Micawber argues that the \"fallacious [experiment]\" (DC 425) of coals proves the necessity for Micawber to \"throw down the gauntlet to society\" (DC 427) in No. X. </span></p>"

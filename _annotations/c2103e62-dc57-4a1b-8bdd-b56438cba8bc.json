The notes for No.I signal this relationship, as this lone note for Chapter 3 reads: &ldquo;Esther Summerson / Lady Dedlock&rsquo;s child.&rdquo; The manuscript shows Dickens working to manage this relationship and its disclosure very carefully from the beginning of the novel. Dickens looks to have added to the manuscript the parenthetical description of Lady Dedlock&mdash;&ldquo;(who is childless)&rdquo; (BH 21)&mdash;as a revision in the opening description of her in chapter 2. The subsequent paragraphs describing the marriage between Lady Dedlock and Sir Leicester are heavily edited. Similarly, a later paragraph in chapter 3 in which Esther discusses never having heard her mother spoken of is also heavily edited in the manuscript. In the initial composition of chapter 3, Esther refers to Miss Barbary as her &ldquo;aunt&rdquo; from the outset, both when she is describing her memories and when she is narrating dialogue from that past (Esther pleads with her: &ldquo;Oh, do pray tell me something of her. Do now, at last, dear aunt&hellip;&rdquo;). This would of course imply that Esther knows Miss Barbary&rsquo;s relation to her mother from her earliest days. In the manuscript, Dickens deleted all of these references to &ldquo;aunt&rdquo; and replaced them with the more ambiguous term &ldquo;godmother.&rdquo; Dickens likely makes these edits before he gets to the point later in the composition chapter when Esther learns with surprise from Kenge that Miss Barbary is her aunt (&ldquo;My aunt, sir!&rdquo;) (BH 33). This change is significant for the characterization of Esther&rsquo;s childhood and her feelings of psychological isolation from her mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

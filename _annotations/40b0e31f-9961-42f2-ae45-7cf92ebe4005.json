Daniel Doyce</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-dc08462a-7fff-0940-ccb2-9b205b847fac\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We first encounter the &ldquo;smith and engineer&rdquo; Daniel Doyce collared by Mr. Meagles as Clennam leaves the Circumlocution Office for the second time. In his efforts to obtain a patent for &ldquo;an invention&hellip;of great importance to his country and his fellow creatures,&rdquo; Doyle is treated by the government as &ldquo;a public offender!... as a man who has done some infernal action&rdquo; (LD 113-114). With Doyce, Dickens returns to the theme of his 1850&nbsp;<em>Household Words</em>&nbsp;article &ldquo;A Poor Man&rsquo;s Tale of a Patent,&rdquo; in which he detailed the onerous stages of obtaining a patent in ways that anticipate Doycle&rsquo;s plight: \"Is it reasonable to make a man feel as if, in inventing an ingenious improvement meant to do good, he had done something wrong? How else can a man feel, when he is met with such difficulties at every turn? All inventors taking out a Patent MUST feel so&rdquo; (&ldquo;A Poor Man&rsquo;s&rdquo; 75). The fact that Dickens sets the events of the novel &ldquo;thirty years ago&rdquo; (LD 1) is important here, since it sets Daniel Doyce&rsquo;s struggle before the 1852 Patent Law Amendment Act which would simplify the process. In 1857 Dickens published a piece by frequent contributor George Dodd in&nbsp;<em>Household Words&nbsp;</em>which stated &ldquo;a statute passed in eighteen hundred and fifty-two has brought about a change which renders patent wisdom understandable&rdquo; (&ldquo;A Room Near Chancery Lane&rdquo; 190).</p>"

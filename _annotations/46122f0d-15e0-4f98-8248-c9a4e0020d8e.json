Instead, Flintwinch describes intercepting the letters: &ldquo;When Arthur&rsquo;s mother had been under the care of him and his wife, she had been always writing, incessantly writing,&ndash;mostly letters of confession to you, and Prayers for forgiveness. My brother had handed, from time to time, lots of these sheets to me. I thought I might as well keep them to myself as have them swallowed up alive too; so I kept them in a box, looking over them when I felt in the humour&rdquo; (LD 761).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the manuscript, &ldquo;letters of confession to you&rdquo; was originally written as &ldquo;letters appealing to you,&rdquo; suggesting that as late as the proof stage, Dickens shifts the focus of the mother&rsquo;s letters from desperation to penitence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">No mention is made in the novel of Arthur&rsquo;s mother imploring to see her son, though it is suggested that &ldquo;the absence of Arthur was a daily agony to his mother&rdquo; (LD 755). Similarly, there is no mention of a &ldquo;story&rdquo; left to be read beyond the &ldquo;appeals&rdquo; (turned into &ldquo;confessions&rdquo;). Space constraints would not allow for the inclusion of the mother&rsquo;s story, and the erasure of her story via Little Dorrit&rsquo;s destruction of the letters becomes a pivotal act in the novel&rsquo;s conclusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Garrett Stewart considers this note in &ldquo;Dickens and the Narratography of Closure,&rdquo; reading it as a &ldquo;brief telegraphic reminder&rdquo; that &ldquo;is more than the novel itself makes good on&rdquo; (521):</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The mother&rsquo;s craving for a visit with her child is replaced by a capitulation to guilt, confession, and a plea for forgiveness. It&rsquo;s just as unlikely as it sounds, this sense of penance rather than victimhood&ndash;and just as briefly dispatched amid the other strained and improbable turns of the denouement. This missing mother&rsquo;s story itself goes missing, left in the dust by the momentum of the requisite marriage plot&rdquo; (521-522).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For Stewart, we see here &ldquo;a flash of notebook inspiration potent enough to justify the contortions of the denouement,&rdquo; but Dickens &ldquo;later scrambled to smooth over that claim with an ameliorative vision of continuity rather than of rupture and return&rdquo; (528). To consider the narrative work of this note, for Stewart, is to be &ldquo;listening in&rdquo; on the &ldquo;final exertions of the prose, transacted at the far margins of plot.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>",

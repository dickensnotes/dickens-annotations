In chapter 3, David notes that Mr Peggotty, Ham, Little Em'ly and Mrs Gummidge live in \"a black barge, or some other kind of superannuated boat\" (DC 41) and that Mr. Peggotty \"dealt in lobsters, crabs and crawfish\" (DC 42). While it might seem odd that this is the principal entry for a number that is chiefly preoccupied with David's birth and early memories, it is less surprising considering the extent to which Dickens's January 1849 visit to Yarmouth impressed and inspired him. In a letter to his friend and later biographer, John Forster, he called it \"the success\" of his trip to Norfolk: \"Yarmouth, sir [...] is the strangest place in the wide world: one hundred and forty-six miles of hill-less marsh between it and London. More when we meet. I shall certainly try my hand at it\" (Letters 5.474). These preliminary notes signify a first move in Dickens's attempt to translate his observations into fiction. In the published text David also comments on Yarmouth&rsquo;s odd flatness: \"It looked rather spongy and soppy, I thought, as I carried my eye over the great dull waste that lay across the river; and I could not help wondering, if the world were really as round as my geography book said, how any part of it came to be so flat\" (DC 39). </span></p>",

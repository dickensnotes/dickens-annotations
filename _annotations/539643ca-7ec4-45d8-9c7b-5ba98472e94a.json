Little Dorrit is not mentioned in the Notes for this number. It is in the same breath that Affery mentions Little Dorrit&rsquo;s name that she also mentions this &ldquo;old sweetheart&rdquo;: &ldquo;Oh! She? Little Dorrit? She&rsquo;s nothing; she&rsquo;s a wim of&ndash;hers.&rdquo; It was a peculiarity of Affery Flintwinch that she never spoke of Mrs. Clennam by name. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s another sort of girls than that about. Have you forgot your own sweetheart? Long and long ago, I&rsquo;ll be bound&rdquo;... &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s news for you, then. She&rsquo;s well to do now, and a widow. And if you like to have her, why you can&rdquo; (LD 40). The mention of &ldquo;Little Dorrit&rdquo; here was added in proof, first as &ldquo;Dorrit&rdquo; and then, later, as &ldquo;Little Dorrit&rdquo;; it does not appear in the manuscript.</span></p>"

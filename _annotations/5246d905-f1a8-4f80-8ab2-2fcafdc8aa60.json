In this chapter we learn that &ldquo;He decided to will and bequeath his little property of savings to his godchild, and the point arose how it could be so &lsquo;tied up&rsquo; as that only she should have the benefit of it?&rdquo; However, &ldquo;[h]he deepest character whom the turnkey sounded, was unable to produce his law for tying such a knot as that. So, the turnkey thought about it all his life, and died intestate after all&rdquo; (LD 69). The Turnkey&rsquo;s ineffectual will prefigures the hidden codicil to Gilbert Clennam&rsquo;s will in the novel&rsquo;s final double number.</p>",

This line is significantly reworked in the manuscript, and given the discrepancy between the line on the manuscript and these entries on the Working Note, it is difficult to be sure whether the notes were written before or after the chapter was composed. Working on the hypothesis that the other notes are retroactive, it seems reasonable to assume that these, too, were written after the number's completion, with Dickens loosely approximating the lines based on his memory of what he had written. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

While Richard agrees to the decision, he loses trust in Jarndyce. In pairing Richard's downward progress with the demise of Gridley in this chapter, Dickens heightens the sense of foreboding that accompanies Richard's inability to disentangle his future prospects from the resolution of Jarndyce &amp; Jarndyce. While the bulk of the chapter details the tangible effects of Chancery on those drawn into its operations, the transition from Richard to Gridley is accomplished by Esther's visit to the court to witness its proceedings, which elicits her incredulous rebuke: \"To see everything going on so smoothly and to think of the roughness of the suitors' lives and deaths; to see all that full dress and ceremony and to think of the waste, and want, and beggared misery it represented; to consider that while the sickness of hope deferred was raging in so many hearts this polite show went calmly on from day to day, and year to year, in such good order and composure; to behold the Lord Chancellor and the whole array of practitioners under him looking at one another and at the spectators as if nobody had ever heard that all over England the name in which they were assembled was a bitter jest, was held in universal horror, contempt, and indignation, was known for something so flagrant and bad that little short of a miracle could bring any good out of it to any one&mdash;this was so curious and self-contradictory to me, who had no experience of it, that it was at first incredible, and I could not comprehend it. I sat where Richard put me, and tried to listen, and looked about me; but there seemed to be no reality in the whole scene except poor little Miss Flite, the madwoman, standing on a bench and nodding at it\" (BH 396-7).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Yes</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><br />This is the first time Dickens mentions [Little] Dorrit in the Working Notes. Although she is featured briefly in No. I, it is only in passing in chapter 3 as a character present in the room with Mrs. Clennam whom Arthur notices and about whom he questions Affery. She makes no appearance on the Note for No. I (except perhaps obliquely in the mention of &ldquo;Family and two daughters?&rdquo;). Dickens first tested out Little Dorrit&rsquo;s name in his <em>Memoranda</em> book, which he began in January 1855. On the third page, he includes a list of potential names, including &ldquo;Dorret-Dorrit&rdquo; (after which he has a check mark added later to indicate that he had made use of the name). Throughout this number, the manuscript calls her &ldquo;Dorrit&rdquo;; it wasn&rsquo;t until No. III during the composition of chapter 9 that Dickens would begin to write her name in the manuscript with &ldquo;Little.&rdquo; In the proofs, Dickens adds &ldquo;Little&rdquo; in the margins to Dorrit multiple times, though he missed a few.</p>",

As Sucksmith explains at length, Lord Decimus Tite Barnacle was likely based on then Prime Minister Lord Palmerston, whose ambition, arrogance, and obstructionism Dickens criticized on numerous occasions (Sucksmith xxxi). Palmerston, and his handling of the peace that ended the Crimean War, were evidently on Dickens&rsquo;s mind around the time he was composing this and the next number. On August 13, Dickens wrote to Burdett-Coutts describing Palmerston as &ldquo;the emptiest imposter and the most dangerous delusion, ever known&rdquo; (Letters 8.177). In a letter to Forster a few days earlier, Dickens made explicit the connection between his treatment of &ldquo;the Barnacles and the Circumlocution Office&rdquo; in <em>Little Dorrit</em> and his disgust at the government&rsquo;s handling of the Crimean War (Forster 2.156).&nbsp;</p>"
